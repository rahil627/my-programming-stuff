  - tracks current popularity of SSGs

  - contains a good round-up of the problems of other SSGs, and seeds of why Docusaurus is needed

conclusion:
I would choose Hugo and/or Docusaurus.

Docusaurus seems the best of both worlds: out-of-the-box solutions *and* powerful open-source APIs (React.js, etc.).

Those seem to be the top “out-of-the-box” solutions. The others are more for building sites, and thus require much work. Most of them use React.js (Hexo, Gatsby, etc.).
