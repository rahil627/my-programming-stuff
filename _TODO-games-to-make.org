i've def written this down in some notebook somewhere..

the fighting games however should be in the fighting game project repo


* setup dev / engine / etc.

2. haxe
3. jai

* port/finish all old, simple ideas

these can all be done via dragonruby
  - push it to it's limits!
  - master it!

deployment order:
  1. web
     - if it can be done on web, no reason to do on others..??
  2. android
     - $
  3. ios
     - $$

  1. laser shmup
  2. horse / finger skating
  3. kite fighting
     - these three are fighting/battle games

  4. doodle tangle
     - this is a party game

remake/finish old games:
  - pinkies up
    - requires gamekit/bluetooth for mobile devices..
  - crystal brawl
    - web, switch

* harvest moon / stardew valley / earthbound (without the battle system) small-town JRPG love / a 2d animal crossing! that takes place in TW! <3
  - top-down vs perspective (ragnarok online)
    - TODO: try proto-typing both, see what works with either my own hand-drawn graphics/animations or ai-gen graphics/animations
  - covers 2d top down / JRPG
    - requires tiling, etc.
      - this has been a done a million times, why again?
        - see that one haxe tool for level/map-making..
  - bike around, explore waterfalls, hot springs, mountain valleys, etc.
  - TW
    - east coast
      - valley towns
        - trains
      - coastal towns
    - tapiei / generic big city
    - pingdong / generic farm town
    - tribal village
  - build, eat, talk : live
  - forage, farm
  - vend
    - while i vend in real life
      - art imitates life
      - or art as ideal lifestyle

* battle game makers
  - TODO: see my fighting game anarchy repo..

platformer / side-view
  - super smash bros
  - all traditional "2d fighters"

top-down / angled / 2.5d
  - that one game that simon liked
    - hyperlight drifter!
  - that 3v1 game.. crawl?
    - tight, fast, funky
  - ragnarok online
    - not so much for the battle system, but for how incredible 2d can look!
      - though, the battle system was fine too, lol... just an impossible grind by default
  - fat princess
  - final fantasy tactics?
    - this one was beautiful for a 2d game.. full of seasons, geography, characters..

super mario rpg
  - how was this not 3d..?


3d
  - fez
  - that one samurai game
    - didn't have to be 3d.. just one-hit, tight
