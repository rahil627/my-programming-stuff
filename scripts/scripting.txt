q:
what is the standard for ruby scripts in regards to making them re-usable via pipeline?


answer:
  - kinda perfect answer really..
Creating reusable Ruby scripts that can be easily integrated into pipelines often involves adhering to certain best practices and design principles. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Modularization:** Break your script into smaller, modular components. This makes it easier to reuse specific functionalities and integrate them into different pipelines.

2. **Use Functions/Methods:** Encapsulate logic within functions or methods. This allows you to call specific pieces of functionality as needed.

3. **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Create a CLI interface for your script using tools like `OptionParser` or `Thor`. This allows users to provide input parameters through the command line when running the script.
  - use OptionParser, as it's included in the std lib

4. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - Design your script to accept input from various sources like command line arguments, files, or standard input.
   - Consider allowing users to specify input and output formats, making your script more flexible.

5. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement robust error handling to provide clear error messages when something goes wrong.
   - Consider using exceptions to handle exceptional situations.

6. **Configuration:**
   - Allow users to configure script behavior through configuration files or environment variables.
   - Use sensible defaults to make the script easy to use out of the box.

7. **Documentation:**
   - Include clear and concise documentation that explains how to use the script, its purpose, and any required dependencies.
   - Provide examples of how the script can be used in different pipeline scenarios.

8. **Dependency Management:**
   - If your script relies on external libraries, manage dependencies using tools like Bundler or Gemfiles.
   - Clearly document the required dependencies and versions.

9. **Testing:**
   - Write tests for your script using frameworks like RSpec or MiniTest.
   - Test different scenarios and edge cases to ensure your script works as expected.

10. **Versioning:**
    - If your script evolves over time, consider implementing versioning to manage changes and ensure backward compatibility.

11. **Logging:**
    - Implement logging to provide insights into script execution and debugging information.

12. **Packaging and Distribution:**
    - Consider packaging your script as a gem if it's meant to be widely distributed and reused.
    - Host the gem on RubyGems.org or a private gem server for easy installation.

13. **Code Quality:**
    - Follow Ruby's style guide (like RuboCop) to maintain consistent and clean code.
    - Use meaningful variable and method names to enhance readability.

14. **Source Control:**
    - Use a version control system (e.g., Git) to manage your script's source code. This makes collaboration and versioning easier.

15. **Continuous Integration (CI):**
    - Set up CI/CD pipelines to automatically test and deploy changes to your script.
    - This ensures that your script remains functional as you make updates.

By following these guidelines, you can create reusable Ruby scripts that are well-documented, maintainable, and easily integrable into various pipelines.
