#+title: Todo Programs To Make


see personal notebooks and other writings
see grad school app writings
  - TODO: merge from there
    - use org-mode powers!!

see /scripts/prototypes
  
ordered from simplest to most complex

shiiiit, i've got my work cut out for me..

*OR, fuck web products, just live the life i want to live, and stream it!*
  - youtube/twitch $$

*basically, i'm creating my own view of the world, what i want to see, digitally*
  - without all teh crap, bare-bones, craigslist style

*MAKE GAMES FUCK THE REST.*
  - *web and ai are boring are fuck.*
  - *STICK TO REALITY: COOKING FOOD, MAKING TEA, GARDENING, THAT'S LIFE!!*

* games

i've def written this down in some notebook somewhere..

the fighting games however should be in the fighting game project repo

** setup dev / engine / etc.

1. dragonruby
   - if 2d, low-performance
2. heaps/haxe
   - 2d high-performance or 3d
3. j-blow's engine/jai
   - very-high-performance

** port/finish all old, simple mostly touch-tablet ideas

these can all be done via dragonruby
  - push it to it's limits!
  - master it!

deployment order:
  1. web
     - if it can be done on web, no reason to do on others..??
  2. android
     - $
  3. ios
     - $$

NOTE: the first three are battle games, and maybe even the fourth counts!
  - (crystal brawl is a sports game)
  - (pinkes up is a party game)
  
*** laser shmup

top-down, slow-moving lasers, portals..

bomberman with smash-like settings, but without the block-based sprites

some progressive elements of difficulty:
  - enclosing area/stage
  - speed up/down
    - slow-mo ability? for hard times
  - various objects:
    - reflector
    - mirror (an immovable portal)
    - cutter
    - etc.

*** horse / finger skating/dancing

one player performs a "dance" with their fingers, another tries to follow it, then the first player must repeat it to get a point

some progressive elements of difficulty:
  - maybe can add/allow more touch inputs as time goes on..
  - also can speed up/down time..

*** kite fighting

*** doodle tangle

top-down movement, but using fingers, various 2d levels

*** finish old games

port these to a contemporary framework?

**** pinkies up
  - requires gamekit/bluetooth for mobile devices..
    - in this case, native/cocos2d was actually a good, long-term choice..
**** crystal brawl
  - web, switch
    - maybe construct actually got better.. could just update the construct engine and re-build it..

** harvest moon / stardew valley / earthbound (without the battle system) small-town JRPG love / a 2d animal crossing! that takes place in TW! <3

ART IMITATES LIFE

ART AS IDEAL LIFE

  - top-down (stardew valley) vs perspective (ragnarok online)
    - TODO: try proto-typing both, see what works with either my own hand-drawn graphics/animations or ai-gen graphics/animations
  - covers 2d top down / JRPG
    - requires tiling, etc.
      - this has been a done a million times, why again?
        - see that one haxe tool for level/map-making..
  - bike around, explore waterfalls, hot springs, mountain valleys, etc.
  - TW
    - east coast
      - valley towns
        - trains
      - coastal towns
    - tapiei / generic big city
    - pingdong / generic farm town
    - tribal village
  - build, eat, talk : live
  - forage, farm
  - vend
    - while i vend in real life
      - art imitates life
      - or art as ideal lifestyle

** battle game makers
  - TODO: see my fighting game anarchy repo..

CONCEPTUAL SANDBOX GAME-MAKERS
  
platformer / side-view
  - super smash bros
  - all traditional "2d fighters"

top-down / angled
  - that one game that simon liked..
    - hyperlight drifter!
  - that 3v1 game.. crawl?
    - tight, fast, funky
  - fat princess?
  - final fantasy tactics?
    - this one was beautiful for a 2d game.. full of seasons, geography, characters..
  - super mario rpg
    - how was this not 3d..?

2.5d / perspective
  - ragnarok online
    - not so much for the battle system, but for how incredible 2d can look!
      - though, the battle system was fine too, lol... just an impossible grind by default
  - diablo 1/2

??
  - fez
  
3d
  - that one samurai game
    - didn't have to be 3d.. just one-hit, tight

  
* personal tools/tech/anti-productivity

just open pull requests 'n start discussions/issues as needed

** game/media/io engines
  - let others handle this..
  - though, i can def help with documentation/tutorials/book, as dragonruby, heaps, and luxe all severely need it!!
    
  t. luxe
     - TODO: though, maybe could try again without using the ECS/game editor.. love2d/dragonruby style!
  1. heaps
  2. jon blow's engine
  $. dragonruby

** langs

these languages are so far developed, so complex, i don't think i could ever help..

  1. haxe
  2. jai
  s. (ruby)
    - (particularly its performance-oriented embedded variants)
      - (mruby?)
        $?. dragonruby
          - surely this is the most performant one.. mruby/C and picoruby seem like the just aim for low memory (to fit on an embedded device), not high-performance..
          - not sure if it's available for public-use..
            - TODO: see licensing
          - TODO: not sure if the langauge is seperate from the game engine..
  
** text editors
  - focus
    - port aurara
    - PROJECT: write ruby and haxe lexers in jai
      - see https://github.com/focus-editor/focus/tree/main/src/langs
      - it seems possible even without compiler.. could give it a try and PR it, and have someone else actually test/complete it..
  - textbringer
    - ruby!
    - create basic bindings (next/previous word)
      - download wezterm, may just be a terminal problem..
        - computer fail.
          - TODO: alacritty? foot! lol
    - make it generally more usable
  - emacs
    - port aurara
    - makes emacs more gamey, with more visual effects!
    - set-up emacs for touch-input
      - PROJECT: design emacs for touch-input
    - haxe lsp integration
      - PROJECT: requires re-organizing the current vs-code-oriented lsp to be modular
  - zed
    - download and use it again!!
      - nope.. need a real computer, lmao
    - can focus on making shit!!
** TODO gui?

basic css ("classless") vs generated web (streamlit, nicegui) vs imgui?

TEMP: TODO: merged from elsewhere:
setup heaps and imgui
try imgui with ruby!
  - https://github.com/vaiorabbit/ruby-imgui


  

* apps / tech

NOTE: there's a TON of ideas here that i could easily generate using ai.. and most of them can be done via simple ruby web apps
  - this is great, broad, PRACTICE

** scraper apps
  - jobs
    - NOTE: currently for personal use only
    - "junior ruby", "game community", "game support", "ruby support"
      - can use emacs to search/filter/grep regex data.. :D
        - emacs as the ultimate data (text) editor
  - *game data*
    1. for game archive site
      - though it uses phoenix, can run as seperate ruby scripts..
  - *cooking recipes/site without the crap*
    - TODO: is this legal?
    - see [site-content-scraper.rb]
    - should work well from a phone
  - no web framework, just a simple ruby script using nokogiri
  -> leads to crawlers
    - *crawl the entire web for stuff??*
    -> may lead to ai agents
      - *ai agents that crawl the web??*
        - sounds like the matrix..!!


# from scraper script
# this is also an interesting program, as it can lead to more general social media / videos / web 2.0 / reality? to web 1.0 / text / database ideas..
#   - every sports game/match (publicly available)
#     - this is actually huge.. $$$
#       - start with ssbm and battle rap (the sports i watch)
#       - then e-sports
#       - then real sports
#       - and movies!
#   - every anything that is publicly available..
#   - every police video doing something wrong
#
#  - yeah... i just need to make shit... i can think of a billion ideas!


** map apps

  - roda
  -> can visualize with a js data viz lib,.. or a js game framework (haxe->js!!) :D
  -> leads to AR app

*** mapping basics
  - start with a simple map using census data
    - could already get advanced, once it goes to other countries..!
    - could show migrations by using historical data (+time)
  - *map areas by livability: walkability/bikability/motorcyclability and zoning laws*
    - *technology to find the best urban area to live in*
    - zones for suburban strip-mall hell-holes vs places like ocean beach, SF, NYC
      - detected by analyzing google maps..?

*** mapping responsibility/acccountability
  - then can try other data
    - judge/police/prosecutor names/locations/info
      - link to people convicted

*** mapping hope
  - then create map apps that allow users to add/update various points of interest
    - squatting, public and private vending locations, farmer's markets, handicraft markets, camping (car, tent, hammock), public restrooms, public libraries, guerilla gardening/farming, etc.
    - vegetarian/vegan restaurants, locally-owned businesses
      - can try scraping from google, yelp, etc.
        - *could create a yelp for vegan/vegetarian only..* *along with other nature-loving businesses*
          - this is leading to *businesses with hope*
    - google maps public map feature?
      - maybe has api for this..



** tech to see history
*** history image AR app
  - scrape photos related to your location
    - or chosen location
  - display them at same coordinate
  - can it be done via web..?
    - sure! just allow access to geolocation sensor

** tech to connect people
  - a new craigslist (classifieds posting)
    - a new job site
  - *a new room and room-mate finder*
    - very much needed..
  - a sharing site
    - tools, house, land, property: commodities

** tech to find great art/products/ideas/things

this is turning out to be a *documentation* project: document and organize the world

most of these are things that can be consumed: consumption consumerism, commodities (except art)

a simple product diplay website
  - could be whatever
    - TODO: what products can use a site make-over?
      - could be whatever i'm passionate about
      - NOTE: possible to make $$$ here.. very easily with a new car site..

*** games
- see [game archive]
*** motorcycles
- really does need a better database/wiki
  - scrape from all sources
  - scrape from motorcycle forums, discord, wikis, etc.
  - allow users to edit
    - link to existing wiki?
  - could also make it pretty like letterboxd
    - allow reviews, user photos, etc.
*** weed
- could easily make the best weed website!
  - search based on effects, inherited strains, etc.
- scrape databases
- have fun making the front-end
  - *it's the ui/ux that sets it apart from the rest*
  - try figma
  - make it trippy using web-gl effects
  - can start with a roda PWA..? or phoenix-live-view?
    - some funky node-based diagram in space, with the images of buds, with lines connected those with relationships
  - should show tree, branch, flower/bud, and then scrape more nice photos of it, when the user asks for it
*** tea
- now that's a bit more sober than weed..!! :)
*** alcohol
- *big $$ here*
*** programming languages
- single page, features matrix, editable
  - might as well use wikipedia instead for this..
*** art
- documenting all art is kinda insane..
  - what is art?? lol
- ...but considering how poorly games are documented, surely all arts suffer form poor documentation.. and amazing unknown artists

** tech for language/cultural preserveration
indigenous languages
a digital visualization of all languages, and how they're connected
  - sounds/phenomes?, vocabulary, etc.
a map overlay of languages spoken (and ethnicity, and culture?, gender?)

indigenous music
  - an app to listen to different areas in the world
    - ambience, but also including indigenous dances, day-to-day talking, singing at night

building homes
cooking
foraging
farming
games
etc.

** tech for nature preservation
easily see a map of all real nature ("old growth"), fake nature (cut and re-planted)

** tech about plants, herbs, food
tech that links plants to herbal and food recipes
  - pharmacology?

** tech for responsiblity
*** tech to calculate the people/govs responsible killing the planet the most
this'll be interesting to build an equation for.. ecological damage

also a good visualization

**** tech to calculate the people/govs reponsible for killing other people the most
deadliest people
