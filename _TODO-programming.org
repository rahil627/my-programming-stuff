a general catch-all file for TODOs related to programming..

..for the few things i don't do in emacs..
  - (though it surely can do it..!)
  - (there's a seperate todo list in the config file for that..)

GOAL: for the most part, should just keep the TODOs in the file, where the thought came from, and search/grep (dir) them via emacs
  - TODO: i haven't even got to this..!!


* list
  
set-up ai for emacs
  - (likely also in the emacs todo list..)
    - but IMPORTANT!
  -> quickly generate app ideas (in ruby)
    - see [programs-to-make#apps]
  -> quickly make simple 2d game ideas (in dragonruby)

p/migrate from github (m$) to gitlab
  - see reasons in [version-control]
  - uh oh.. may have created two accounts..??
    - try logging in via github.com..?
    - try forgot password..??
  - p/import from github
    - go through each one
      - delete some
        - NOTE: deleted 'important facebook feed', one of my first programming/digital ideas
      - skim and delete some
        - old game prototypes
          - actually, can keep some of them, as the engines i chose are timeless..
      - merge some
      - star some
        - may have to keep github for bookmarking repos..
        - or can port ones with MIT license, adding it to an archive group
  - gitlab has "groups", so i can neatly categorize it into my own idea(l)s(!!)
    - rahil627?
    - rathewolf
      - mostly private
      - my web-site (ssg'd via jekyll)
      - my notes
      - personal game projects
    - willowolf
      - public
      - ideal directions:
        - game anarchy
          - game-archive? (or whatever i call this project..)
          - open-source game sandboxes/frameworks
        - nature's guardian's
        - experimental games(?)
        - etc.

create a repo in home folder, ignoring everything except my emacs and focus configs
  - TEMPFIX: for the moment i just created a copy-configs script in /configs/copy-configs (symlink)
  - see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21266948/use-git-to-manage-home-directory
  - x/or file-watchers to update my catch-all repo..
    - git makes more sense.. as you don't want a bunch of file-watchers running all the time..


** set-up offline-dev
GOAL: *should aim to put everything you need into source repo*

devdocs.io
  - click on or enable the languages you need
    - NOTE: doesn't have docs for external libs
  - download them to use offline
    - devdocs.io/offline

download learn x in y minutes for each lang?

TODO: surely there's some cheat-sheet web-site..
  - zenspider.com/ruby/quickref.html
    - TODO: download this!
    - nice!

ai
  - no offline ai..
    - LLM would require too much compute power
    - though, it would provide privacy..! and not participate in giving data to the ai..



*** haxe

just download the docs / web-site / manual / cookbook
download heaps web-site
std lib is really good, simple enough to immediately use!
 
*** ruby


still seems best to just use ai to auto-generate some boiler-plate code, and work from there..

ri
  - ruby comes with it..
  - maybe have to run it once..?
  - seems to grep docs straight from the code..
    - can search objects, functions, possibly vars
  - TODO: not sure how to browse objects though..
  - f/b to move down/up
  - q to quit

pry
  - how does this differ from ri?
  
github.com/khusnetdinov/rub.fundamental
  - patterns, principles, structures, threads



**** install some gems

gems come with docs, and sometimes even provide examples

dragonruby
  - *incredible samples*..
    - simple, no modules, classes, or anything fancy
    - *nothing beats learning via game-dev!*

rails
  - gem install rails
    - *just installing this will get you most of the web gems you'd ever need..*
  - see /guides/

roda
  - gem install roda
  - gitlab.com/fiachetti/mastering-roda
    - *NOTE: an incredible example of a single, giant .org file*
