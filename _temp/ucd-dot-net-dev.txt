heya.

i'm at a point in life where i'm coming back to America, specifically California, for the sole purpose of doing career-related work. I recently finished my trip exploring the coast of Cali by scooter(!!) and now am in San Diego/Baja Cali while i ponder upon some mid-life career directions..

i've been out of the tech world for some time, but recently, during my off-time while working at UC Berkeley (not tech-related), with just an old chromebook at hand, i discovered some newfound joy in computers again while searching for tools to make making games, gui apps, web apps more enjoyable (and i found them!: mruby/dragonruby, haxeui/haxe, elixir/phoenix). The journey led me through a history of programming languages, linux, unix/terminals/shells, all the way back to the beginning with lisp/emacs 'n smalltalk'! It was a fun blast through the past. So now i'm trying to transition towards more general IT jobs like systems admin/devops or specialize in data visualization if i can. However, in this case, i'm applying to this job a sort of comfortable backup, as it was my first ever tech job: an asp.net dev.

it was long, long ago, when linq-to-sql was still new, and i remember when extension methods came out. The code-base was immaculate, as it was coded by a rather gifted autistic developer. There were only 3 devs and one business-man, so it was full on dev, 8-10 hours a day. Though not healthy, it was actually the most straight-forward software dev work i've done and served as a great foundation, as asp.net provided the framework to work in, allowing me to just focus on dev. At the time it was great, and now i've read that with core/razor/entity/blazor .net is at it's best, and i don't doubt it. I even like powershell. Though i've recently personally chose phoenix framework for my own use, as i really like ruby and the idea of a functional paradigm alongside BEAM, i think it'd be cool to catch up on contemporary .net too, as it has come a long, long way since.

beyond the inital few pro tech jobs i did, most of my tech experience came from my passion for making games (including video games). As it only requires pure systems programming, i lack the contemporary large-scale web app pro work experience to compete in today's market, especially in the SF Bay Area: js frameworks, cloud computing / container orchestration, language modelling, software for massive scale. I'm actually more interested in the cloud platforms engi job but my past experiences only allow me a sliver of hope getting a job as a .net dev, maybe a data viz dev, or a junior sys admin. Most recruiters just don't care about game-making, and .net seems to be considered rather insular skill, separated from js frameworks, akin to ruby on rails (though Canvas uses it..!).

my nature prefers the chaos of talking and supporting everyone in a community, whilst doing several tasks on several projects on my own, learning and doing a bit of everything. I think i'd be satisfied working at a small media production or startup where it's very DIY and where everyone does everything, but for big institutions like this, i think i could find a home in a department: game, film, new media, tech, design, arts: humanities. I hope that i can share some knowledge 'n wisdom with the folks at IET, and do some work beyond the .net world, perhaps with the infrastructure folks. But then again, nothing's better than working from home! ;)

though Davis wasn't part of my trip down the Cali coast, i don't mind re-locating there for the job. It sounds like a wonderful way to try rural life in America for a bit. I noticed that the IET office is near vegetable greenhouse and bees, which is great as i'm into permaculture/homesteading, and biking!! It honestly sounds like the last pleasant UC, though i'd miss the beach dearly..

anyway, please e-mail me, as i'll be getting another phone in Mexico!
