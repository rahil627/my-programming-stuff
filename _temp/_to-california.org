  - *stick to SF/Bay Area for startup work/learning/experience/network/relations*
  - stick to SC for rad nature-loving community living, or to just take a break from the Bay Area
  - *go back to NYC for the real deal*
  - can *try long beach city, though, more for warm weather, community, events, restaurant/cafe/delivery/event work*
    - need a car to live out there 'n find a place, as there are no hostels nearby

  - *mostly transient, half are international students*
  - no ocean, just the bay
    - not even close to the same vibe!!

    - possibly the center of woke culture
    - just far more complacent, business without assimilation
  - *has the most amount of neighborhoods, especially cultural ones*
    - *basically, the rest of SoCal, and even NorCal (except SF and SC), can be found in LA:*

    - *LBC*
      - *the only thing good about LA..??*
      - *oakland on the sea*

  - north county
    - *endless beaches, all bought up, owned by and live in by white people*
      - mostly rich white families (with businesses elsewhere?) with boats, SUVs, and other boy toys
    - similar to west LA (manhattan/hermosa beach), but newer/later history
    - oceanside
      - may be the exception, with *a great weekly street market* (biggers than ocean beach!)

  - all white along the coast, no minorities in north county
    - except a valley inland from oceanside: vista, san marcos, escondido

  - tiny filipino population stuck in bay terraces, surrounded by latino nieghborhoods and the naval base
  - south and south-east is all latino! and a few black people

LA
  - *most diverse, by far, makes San Diego look like a joke, until south Bay Area*
  - *long beach, only beach area that's not white (black, latino, and south-east asian!)*

* random research
** reddit tidbits
https://www.reddit.com/r/aznidentity/comments/vjg4h6/some_observations_about_the_bay_area_from_an_la/
  - hmmmm, super interesting sub-reddit


an interesting bit on LA history..:

Just to put the SGV into perspective. Housing segregation was still a thing well into the 1980s. In many SGV ghetto areas, it was 5% to 10% Asian in the late 19th and early 20th century (and majority Mexican), when it was more agricultural. They lived in work camps at first, as contract labor. These camps became ghettos. So the area was prepped to become the SGV it is today, because of these seed communities.

Read this: https://imdiversity.com/villages/asian/history-of-asians-in-the-san-gabriel-valley/

That's also why the SGV was never really fully white. Nor was it ever fully considered "LA", because it was never able to wipe out these old Mexican and Asian populations. Also, some of the original whites into the area, like Temple and Workman, sided with Mexico in the Mexican-American war, and bailed out after the war.

You don't see all these roots anymore, because a lot of the people were Japanese, and put into the concentration camps during WW2, and the communities were wiped out. Also, there were Chinese camps, and towns, and those got burnt or buried. There was also a Korean town, I think, in the Inland Empire, and that's also gone.

Also, Chinese have been in the City of LA since the 1850s. By 1870s, there was a Chinatown of around 200 people. Then there was the massacre. Later, that small Chinatown was wiped out by the train station and freeway.





It is related to the % Whites in neighborhoods.

The most un-Asian/white-washed/self-hatred places are all the suburbs over 80% Whites.

The most AZN places are somewhere like Honolulu (16% Whites) , enclaves in and around LA ( Monterey Park 4% Whites) , and enclaves in NYC ( Sunset Park 10%, Flushing 9%)

Let me make it clear, it's not about % of Asians, but % of Whites.

Places like Irvine, West Bay, Seattle, Vancouver, despite with large Asian population, are very different from Honolulu or LA ( at least currently) . Because the % of Whites is still very large.
