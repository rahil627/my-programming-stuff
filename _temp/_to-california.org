** endless car-centric suburbia..

LA
  - TEMP: i may reconsider that this may actually be better than berkeley, SD, and surely SJ..
  - has *by far the best energy out of all of California, from SD to SF*
    - *generally fitter, healthier, happier, more energetic people, the opposite of stingy*
    - *attracts artists, especially performance artists*

      - like south bay and suburban asian san diego, the dirty version
      - *endless tract houses 'n strip malls, welcome to car city*
        - *SGV scared me.. those are not the Asians i was lookin' for..*
  - *UCLA*
    - *the best campus and food*
      - *TODO: hmmm, maybe not a bad place to work.. i mean, if you're going to be on the campus everyday anyway..*
    - near hip hollywood, or homeless hollywood.. and burnt malibu/santa monica
  - UCI
    - south OC is rich old money
    - shit campus, similar to UCSD
    - *highest amount of asians* out of all the UCs

san diego
  - *basically, a duller, mellow LA with nice beaches and cleaner, newer development*
    - *lacks the energies of: artist culture of LA, tech-startup culture of SF, and research culture of Berkeley 'n Stanford*
  - *north park*
    - *hip, young, lively, diverse, subruban-bikeable small town*, most sim
      - lots of indie shops 'n restaurants (and not in strip malls!!)
      - a little strange though, like a suburban neighborhood turned hot-spot, like berkeley..
        - still made for cars
    - *perfect location*:
      - *in-between bedroom asian and latino neighborhoods*, where you can get real food
      - close to ocean beach and mission/pacific beach!
        - yet far enough to avoid the cold, coastal weather
  - *ocean beach*
    - *a small, dumpy, beloved beach-town of it's own..*
    - *like haight st., can get old quick*, though, still cool, as far as music performances go
    - very white
    - *the water is COLD*
    - *often has weird cold beach weather*
  - *endless beaches*
    - *all bought up, owned by and live in by white people*
  - asian neighborhoods
    - at 3x the price of VA Beach..
    - *strip mall and SUV city, like an extension of LA*
      - not the asians i'm interested in!!
    - *no black people in most of San Diego??*
    - a cooler/chiller alternative to OC..?
  - latino neighborhoods
    - *more diverse, including a few black and filipino enclaves*
  - transient population
  - lots of tourists
    - they stick to the beaches though.. and bring in easy money!
    - and probably bring the prices up too..
  - *chill surfer/skater/bohemian culture*
    - gets old.. i prefer the energy of NYC, and probably LA too
  - *car-camping culture*
    - *RV camps, park next to beach, everything!*
    - *truly stress free*
  - school is lame, STEM only..
    - the school's campus is also lame: modern 1960s office buildings, car-centric
    - kinda in the middle of rich areas: surrounded by the beach, torrey pines, la jolla, small hill/valley neighborhoods

berkeley
  - suburban, but probably not as as bad as south bay/socal
    - probably closest to north park, san diego
    - a suburb with some essence of life in it.. though not much anymore
    - flea markets, thrift stores, leaving belongings you don't need on the street, garage sales, etc.
  - *boring AF*
    - very limited by it's size and population, a similar problem to santa cruz and north park
    - really need to know where to go, make friends, attend house gatherings 'n parties
      - like an older, more mature SF
    - *also limited by morals, as the population is a bit more wiser, though, surprisingly, lacking in creativity, performance, arts*
  - the school's new (as of 2024) design department seems lame..
  - *mostly transient, half are international students*
  - no ocean, just the bay
    - not even close to the same vibe!!
    - *feel trapped :(*
      - SF's hikes are far better, and far more accessible too!i
        - if it's ever warm enough to hike, that is..
  - screeching BART to SF not fun
    - nor is the bay bridge
  - *old liberal vibe*
    - *hatch-backs, station wagons, economical, conscious of waste*
  - old academic anarchists
    - stuck in the 60s-80s

san jose
  - *OC (also called "south bay"), but with even more tech bros, and no girls, at all*
  - at least people actually live here though.. compared to transient berkeley and SF..??
    - not a good thing, as i saw in the suburbs of san diego..
  - no beach..? what about mountains..? waterfalls? rivers??
    - i think i'd feel trapped here..





* ride back up the coast
https://bestneighborhood.org/race-in-san-diego-ca/i
  - a great site to see the racial divide in America, and find liveable places amongst other minorities
  - all white along the coast, no minorities in north county
    - except a valley inland from oceanside: vista, san marcos, escondido
  - asians, mostly east asians, are stuck in the middle, upper-class suburbia in mira mesa, sorrento valley, etc. super boring. they go to convey to eat out
      - had a bad history with the chinese, with chinatown taken down for city renovations
  - tiny filipino population stuck in bay terraces, surrounded by latino nieghborhoods and the naval base
  - south and south-east is all latino! and a few black people
    - probably the only diverse place to live.. with low-income housing

LA
  - *most diverse, by far, makes San Diego look like a joke, until south Bay Area*
  - *long beach, only beach area that's not white (black, latino, and south-east asian!)*
  - asians in:
    - notably divided by race
    - san gabriel, rowland heights/diamond bar hills, eastvale
      - FAR from everything!.. but they built their own world, i guess...??
    - *OC: irvine, viet in garden grove and westminister, artesia, NE of buena park*
      - *access to the better beaches, LBC, and DTLA. not bad..*

*oxnard*
  - latino
    - try it out..?

no asian until near UCSB

santa maria
  - latino

SLO
  - all white

hwy 101: soledad, salinas
  - all latinos

*watsonville*
  - all latino
  - good stop before santa cruz..

bay area
  - san jose, fremont, hayward, tri-valley
  - vallejo

sacramento
  - south of sac, in elk grove

NOTHING UNTIL SEATTLE
  - a few sprinkles in portland, but likely too gloomy, rainy for most asians






* random research


** reddit tidbits
https://www.reddit.com/r/aznidentity/comments/vjg4h6/some_observations_about_the_bay_area_from_an_la/
  - hmmmm, super interesting sub-reddit


an interesting bit on LA history..:

Just to put the SGV into perspective. Housing segregation was still a thing well into the 1980s. In many SGV ghetto areas, it was 5% to 10% Asian in the late 19th and early 20th century (and majority Mexican), when it was more agricultural. They lived in work camps at first, as contract labor. These camps became ghettos. So the area was prepped to become the SGV it is today, because of these seed communities.

Read this: https://imdiversity.com/villages/asian/history-of-asians-in-the-san-gabriel-valley/

That's also why the SGV was never really fully white. Nor was it ever fully considered "LA", because it was never able to wipe out these old Mexican and Asian populations. Also, some of the original whites into the area, like Temple and Workman, sided with Mexico in the Mexican-American war, and bailed out after the war.

You don't see all these roots anymore, because a lot of the people were Japanese, and put into the concentration camps during WW2, and the communities were wiped out. Also, there were Chinese camps, and towns, and those got burnt or buried. There was also a Korean town, I think, in the Inland Empire, and that's also gone.

Also, Chinese have been in the City of LA since the 1850s. By 1870s, there was a Chinatown of around 200 people. Then there was the massacre. Later, that small Chinatown was wiped out by the train station and freeway.





It is related to the % Whites in neighborhoods.

The most un-Asian/white-washed/self-hatred places are all the suburbs over 80% Whites.

The most AZN places are somewhere like Honolulu (16% Whites) , enclaves in and around LA ( Monterey Park 4% Whites) , and enclaves in NYC ( Sunset Park 10%, Flushing 9%)

Let me make it clear, it's not about % of Asians, but % of Whites.

Places like Irvine, West Bay, Seattle, Vancouver, despite with large Asian population, are very different from Honolulu or LA ( at least currently) . Because the % of Whites is still very large.
