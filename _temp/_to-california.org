  - all white along the coast, no minorities in north county
    - except a valley inland from oceanside: vista, san marcos, escondido
  - asians, mostly east asians, are stuck in the middle, upper-class suburbia in mira mesa, sorrento valley, etc. super boring. they go to convey to eat out
      - had a bad history with the chinese, with chinatown taken down for city renovations
  - tiny filipino population stuck in bay terraces, surrounded by latino nieghborhoods and the naval base
  - south and south-east is all latino! and a few black people
    - probably the only diverse place to live.. with low-income housing

* random research


** reddit tidbits
https://www.reddit.com/r/aznidentity/comments/vjg4h6/some_observations_about_the_bay_area_from_an_la/
  - hmmmm, super interesting sub-reddit


an interesting bit on LA history..:

Just to put the SGV into perspective. Housing segregation was still a thing well into the 1980s. In many SGV ghetto areas, it was 5% to 10% Asian in the late 19th and early 20th century (and majority Mexican), when it was more agricultural. They lived in work camps at first, as contract labor. These camps became ghettos. So the area was prepped to become the SGV it is today, because of these seed communities.

Read this: https://imdiversity.com/villages/asian/history-of-asians-in-the-san-gabriel-valley/

That's also why the SGV was never really fully white. Nor was it ever fully considered "LA", because it was never able to wipe out these old Mexican and Asian populations. Also, some of the original whites into the area, like Temple and Workman, sided with Mexico in the Mexican-American war, and bailed out after the war.

You don't see all these roots anymore, because a lot of the people were Japanese, and put into the concentration camps during WW2, and the communities were wiped out. Also, there were Chinese camps, and towns, and those got burnt or buried. There was also a Korean town, I think, in the Inland Empire, and that's also gone.

Also, Chinese have been in the City of LA since the 1850s. By 1870s, there was a Chinatown of around 200 people. Then there was the massacre. Later, that small Chinatown was wiped out by the train station and freeway.





It is related to the % Whites in neighborhoods.

The most un-Asian/white-washed/self-hatred places are all the suburbs over 80% Whites.

The most AZN places are somewhere like Honolulu (16% Whites) , enclaves in and around LA ( Monterey Park 4% Whites) , and enclaves in NYC ( Sunset Park 10%, Flushing 9%)

Let me make it clear, it's not about % of Asians, but % of Whites.

Places like Irvine, West Bay, Seattle, Vancouver, despite with large Asian population, are very different from Honolulu or LA ( at least currently) . Because the % of Whites is still very large.
