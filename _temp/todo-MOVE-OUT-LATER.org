this serves as a todo list during travel using/learning the ways of (doom) emacs



TODO: todo list for doom emacs
  - aka make emacs my home
**setup git**
**fix $doomdir**
  - NOTE: github issue
  - doom emacs currently doesn't recognize "~/.doom.d/" for doom configs dir
set org dir
  - need to do this in order to link org files
  - is it possible to have multiple org dirs?
  - otherwise, should set the org dir to the parent repos folder?
  - or maybe create a new folder, with all the notes repos?
org id?
  - set org-id-link-to-org-use-id
**try meow bindings**
  - **NOTE: do this before it's too late!!**
  - just seems far less intrusive to the ways of emacs, requiring far less configs than vi/evil-mode, while still adding a kakoune-style workflow, which requires less memory/cognitive load
  - https://github.com/meow-edit/doom-meow
    - need to find a way to combine doom and meow...
**fix doom gui**
  - colors suck on the default chromeos terminal
  - also copy/paste sucks
    - remember: right click to paste in
**get a better theme**
  - TEMP: using tokyo-night for now
  - NOTE: fix gui first. then don't have to bother with getting a better terminal app
  - highlights in diff are useless, and plain text is too boring, and comments are too dark
re-map/bind keys
  - NOTE: do after setting up/trying meow bindings
    - still prefer a lot of evil bindings, especially for things like dired, navigation in the mini-buffer, etc.
    - really miss the / and : vi bindings
      - m-x and m-c-s are terrible
  - redo sucks
  - going to next paragraph sucks: gets stuck on empty lines
    - or, just doesn't work at all..!
edit the welcome screen
  - add spc-f-f
  - add spc-g
try to setup doom emacs on *everything*
  - NOTE: would require a key-board..
    - take an apple keyboard instead of chromebook?
  - chromebook
    - i really do like this keyboard.. and the battery life is incredible, and it costs nothing... easy to throw around, charge in public places, and not worry about..
      - the giant control, alt, and caps lock keys work really well, and are simple to bind via chromeos settings
  - ipad mini 2
  - android obamaphones
    - heard it has a very good (and free!) terminal app..
  - iphone 7
  - iphone SE
    - likely not enough battery
