what interests you about working at USC and this position?

USC fits my scholarly interests 'n style, and just so happens to be accessible from where i want to set my American roots in, after having lived in Asia, mostly Taiwan, for the decade: Pasadena / San Gabriel Valley, and K-town to reduce commute while working. USC, in my mind, seems to be most comparable to NYU, which is where a lot of my DIY art peers in NYC went to (ITP, film), and Parson's at The New School, which is where i was accepted for a MFA in Design and Technology, but ultimately did not attend, as my mind at the time was in a different world, physically and figuratively. Another interest in USC is the family aspect. I'm old now, built my roots in Taiwan, and now hope to build some secondary roots while i'm in America. My self-seeking phase is over. I now know what i want, from both places. After just having lived and worked in Berkeley for the past few months, i know i could never live nor work in such a transitional place. A school located in the heart of a city has the heart of the city. Dividing a school from an urban center of civilization produces alienation, losing sense of identity and place in the world. The people at USC, i believe, intuitively understands that, just as the universities in NYC do. NYC, however, is not a place i'd personally want to have a family in, a home in: LA is.

This position seems to be a sort of jack-of-all-trades do-it-yourself maker job, which is quite a rare fit for me. My childhood interests were in film, which was my first great educational resource, and games, my first passion and first art medium. Though i've avoided getting into web 'n app development during most my lifetime (my first job was a .NET ASP thing) as i leaned on the more humanities, humanitarian, nature sides of life, recently, i gazed over current dev tech, decided web is indeed inevitably the main platform nowadays, and chose phoenix/elixir for my own personal app ideas. I didn't get too far, but alongside discovering and using DragonRuby for some old simple 2d game ideas, i'm quite happy to have spent some time to finally find some tools that i love, enjoy using, especially for web. I'm not the sort of person to make things from scratch: I naturally tend to find neat tools to elegantly solve or make anything i want, but, recently, i found making [2d] games from scratch has been quite a cathartic experience; And now with AI, i wonder, how many solutions are better off simply solved bottom-up?

Anyway, as you'll see in my resume, i tend to aid communities. I'm the space-maintainer, but also, handler of all things techinical, doing the practical work: from keeping the kitchen clean to cooking to maintaining the building to aiding technical and/or art projects to laboring on the farm. I'm used to working from the grassroots. A university setting isn't my thing, wayyy too far detached, but i'm willing to give one in the city a try.

Though architecture isn't my forte--in fact, i might be anti-architecture until i understand more about it--i've had some urban planning thoughts during my time transitioning to NYC, and again to Taipei, and human geography thoughts while traveling, because space is quite a big factor to my own mind. I did some readings on urban planning a little later, Lynch's Image, Alexander's Design Patterns, etc., but also, my wilder side at the time really digged the Situationist's pycho-geography. Haha. I was young. Since then, i've long left such developed civilization and am now only interested in building primitive shacks with nearby natural materials, or, repairing old Japanese vans. Surely there's something to learn from the department.. As far as LA goes, building a flower of hope in the subruban sprawl of San Gabriel Valley will be quite a grand struggle in itself. Surely America has crushed the work/residential zone crap out?.. Anyway, living in LA, after having lived in NY and SF in my lifetime, will surely conjure some thoughts.

hmm i'd have to think about how i feel about humans living in dense cities as opposed to villages some more, but i'm all down for the back-to-traditional-village/town movements in Taiwan..
