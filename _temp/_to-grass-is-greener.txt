personal choices:
  1. hawaii
    - many islands to wander!
    - big island
      - hilo
        - has a uni campus!!
          - most ideal
  2. coastal cali
    - santa barbara, santa cruz, etc.
  3. south-east coast and/or appalachians
    - appalachians too white, and i need my coast.. i think

Southwest (Arizona, Nevada, California[, new mexico, hill country texas]) Southeast (Georgia, north and South Carolina, Tennessee) Hawaii
  - NOTE: all of these have the climate i love too!!


*. hawaii
  - year-round ridin'
    - must acclimate to riding in the rain, but warm rain
1. cali
  - year-round ridin'
    - no rain!!
  - coast, mountain, desert, everything

?. south-east coast (va/na/sc/florida)

?. appalachians (tennessee, ga, nc, sc)
  - blue ridge parkway
  - shanendoah valley
    - staunton
    - harrisonburg
      - college-town, chain stores, no culture
    - lexington
    - "Also, there's a steep cultural (red/blue) divide between the rural areas and the towns you mentioned. Staunton, Lexington, Harrisonburg, Waynesboro, Charlottesville, and Albemarle County are all blue (check the precinct voting records from 2016 and 2018) However, Augusta, Rockingham, and Rockbridge County are red. For example, you'll notice a huge difference between the City of Harrisonburg and surrounding Rockingham County. Ditto for Staunton and Augusta County."
  - *rainy and cold during the winter*, the closer to the mountains you get: 20s in harrisonburg, 30s for charlottesville
  - *far more rainy than the west coast*
  - no coast / ocean
  - very very white


"dont forget about the Appalachians. Tennessee, west Va, VA, Western MD and PA. Anywhere around the dragon is some of the best riding in the country. In cali I worry about sand and rocks sending you off a cliff."

"Cali\colorado get lots of love, i think cali is at least an order of magnitude behind the smoky's and colorado is worlds behind cali."




hawaii
  - much cooler than SE America, thanks to the ocean winds
    - epecially when compared to houston!
    - 100F is a record in 1931
  - honestly, making a home here makes the most sense... Cali and the appalachians are big.. and just not as interesting as hawaii

houston
  - swampy weather
    - HOT and humid
      - hotter than hawaii
  - diverse
    - 50% latino, 25% black, 20% white, 7% asian
    - great food
  - cheap housing
    - $250k?
  - very dangerous for motorcylists
    - https://www.reddit.com/r/houston/comments/zw8t1k/what_is_it_like_owning_a_motorcycle_in_houston/
    - "I lived in Houston for three years and it was my least favorite city to ride around in the US."
    - "Yeah, need to head north/north west to get decent riding, outside of occasionally commuting for work I don't ride inside the beltway any more"
    - "In Houston as well and done numerous bike trips in California. Yeah, Houston is the fucking worst in every measurable way except maybe being able to ride in winter months. I only ride here because I really love motorcycles but it’s honestly a waste even owning a bike here."
  - very boring car rides
    - flat, endless

florida
  - flat, boring, traffic, hot, terrible drivers

NYC
  - possibly the worst riding
    - stick to subway 'n biking



some well-liked places:

https://www.reddit.com/r/SameGrassButGreener/comments/1df49h9/where_would_you_rather_live_north_carolina_in_the/

richmond
  - I love Richmond. It’s a medium-sized city with endless character and so much to do.

    I personally find the sprawl of the triangle to be really frustrating and I feel like the area is a bit sterile.

  - Agreed completely. To be honest I love Richmond: it embodies both the best and worst of America. Solid job opportunities, outdoor amenities (mountains and beach not too far, the James river is gorgeous), great food, music, arts, and strong local support for small businesses. However, the city also suffers from significant inequality, with stark contrasts between wealthy areas and those struggling with poverty and housing issues. So much character and history.

  - The triangle is much better than Richmond in tech and biotech and has much stronger universities and better pay. Richmond has more of a music/arts scene and has some banking (capital one, truist), some healthcare (VCU related clinical/research as well as Anthem), a federal reserve branch, state govt, and some tobacco industry jobs (altria/philip morris). It's not struggling, but it's also not the strongest economically and especially not in R&D roles.

  - Richmond is not a huge metro area but has a lot to offer culturally thanks to history and being the state capital. Pretty well preserved inside the city limits and honestly if it were closer to the coast like Savannah and Charleston it'd be more well known. If you like hipster bullshit (and frankly, I do, nature vs nurture I guess) then it's a good city for that. Stronger alternative scene than you might expect. Apparently a bit insular to people who have moved there according to r/rva but I can't really comment because if anything I'm part of the problem being there.

  - I love Richmond if you want to live a walkable lifestyle in city limits, but if you're planning on living in the burbs, the Triangle is probably better. Charlottesville is significantly smaller but has much better hiking, but is also getting surprisingly expensive. In tech the Triangle has by far the strongest job market out of the three.

    As a single crunchy lesbian who likes a creative environment, living in the right neighborhoods in Richmond City is just amazing. There's plenty of fun outdoor stuff to do here, lots to do in walking distance of my place, there's a creative energy to the city, and the dating scene is good. I'm liberal but fairly moderate and religious, and Richmond has a good scene for that vibe. People don't judge me at all for being gay here, but they also don't judge me for being Christian. The main downside of the city is that the job market in my field isn't great.


charlottesville
  - Charlottesville itself is progressive leaning as it’s a college town. The entire area surrounding Charlottesville until reaching Richmond & Lynchburg is solid MAGA territory complete with the signs, flags & pickup trucks.

  - Charlottesville is a college town and really has that classic cinematic type atmosphere around town. When it's on it's on but also good luck getting around town on Game Day or Graduation. But, its also much smaller than Richmond (which is smaller than Raleigh) but thanks to a number of factors still can have big city prices. Right against the blue ridge you're closer to a ton of outdoor opportunities though if you're into that.

  - I grew up in Cville from 98-2007. Amazing place. Truly one of my favorite places in the world. It’s become a lot more expensive and bougie but the outskirts are still the same. There’s a lot of old horse money there and land stays within families and remains protected. Suburban sprawl is quite limited and the natural landscape is protected. Housing is limited however and expensive.

  - I’ve been living in the Triangle since 2016. Id pick Cville anyday. Cville is just more expensive and the job opportunities there are limited because they’re mostly related to UVA. Triangle has UNC, NC State, and Duke, plus the triangle is a tech and research hub. Public schools are much better in Cville. I prefer the political climate in Cville as well. Rural NC gets pretty backwards very quickly. Cville is very liberal leaning but the outer counties lean more red/moderate. I find that whole area less evangelical/bible belt-y than NC. Nature is much better in Cville with the mountains and quick access to hiking, skiing, plus vineyards and breweries etc. Downtown Cville revivals any downtown area in the triangle. The triangle has nothing like the pedestrian downtown mall in Cville. Only thing triangle has on cville is more job opportunities and an international airport.p

  - NOTE: surrounded by 80% white metro area, so it's just a college-town pocket, whereas richmond is a small city (just don't go out of it either..)



The triangle: pros: bigger airport, more job opportunities cons: traffic, sprawl

Richmond: pros: culture, urban amenities, lowest cost of living of the three cons: smaller airport, certain areas nicer than others, have heard it is hard to crack the social scene but no personal experience

Charlottesville pros: culture, close to great nature, walkable, good amount of urban amenities for its small size cons: smaller, high cost of living for a small city if you want to be close to things, tiny airport

I was deciding between Richmond and Charlottesville and ultimately chose Charlottesville mostly due to family being close by. I don’t think you could go wrong with either and should be able to get a decent hike in either for 600k, but it will go further in Richmond. Haven’t lived in the triangle, but heard it has gotten more sterile as it has expanded. But I will note it is the most legit city out of the three.



to raleigh, durhman, u?


RDU is a much bigger metro area and major job market. Twice as big as Richmond's metro area. And also more spread out thanks to the multiple cities (Durham and Raleigh mainly) it developed out of. Raleigh is a bit more clean cut and buttoned up while Durham is a bit funkier/alternative.

Which is funny because the schools in either place (NC State and Duke) are very much the opposite in that. Then there's UNC/Chapel Hill but I was surprised how small Chapel Hill was.

Honestly, Raleigh/Durham to me feels like if you took Richmond and somehow flattened it out with a giant dough roller across a much bigger area. So at least to me I think it's not just homer-ism that would have me pick Richmond out of the three. Plus for major events that do hit big cities you're about equidistant to either Raleigh or DC in that case.


chapel hill
  - I'm trying to think if Chapel Hill or ECU would be more considered this. Chapel Hill is probably the closest to hippy/super progressive liberalism while ECU is known as the party school.
















some more places to avoid:

I've been in the field for a long time. Professionally for about 12yrs, but I graduated at 27 because I was military. But I have been tech nerd since the 90s and have paid pretty close attention to the field my entire teenage and adult life.

I would probably say in the sheer number of jobs and companies, that NY is probably ahead of Raleigh, but it's not a place a lot of people who aren't from the area are keen to move to. But even though it's not really on a ton of people's radar to move to but they have a population size where that doesn't matter.

Chicago is mostly a financial center like Charlotte, but way more involved in that sector at least when it comes to technology. There are jobs there, but not tech companies. The best paying companies there are going to be things along the lines of hedge funds, which I've heard is insanely stressful. Weirdly enough, I would say that most of the people I've worked with who were remote in my entire career were based out of Chicago. Even at companies where full remote was a thing, but super rare. I want to say 3 of my current teammates live there.

The opportunities in Denver and Boulder are absolutely abysmal, because this is where I tried to find a job for many years. Most big tech companies actually have satellite offices there, but they are all extremely small and outside of those there are not a lot of software jobs to speak of. Some of the best paying ones I've seen besides those satellite offices have been things like sanitation (like sewage and garbage) and parking. Pretty boring stuff.

ATL is a weird one. There are a lot of software jobs there, but in my experience it's dominated by very low paying contracting companies. Off the top of my head, the only semi-recognizable company based out of ATL is MailChimp and email work is a level of hell most developers do not want to be in. lol I'm sure there are others, but it's not somewhere you see a lot of good listings for

You left out DC and Bethesda, MD though. There are a shit load of jobs there but the CoL is extremely high, due to politicians and lots of medical research. Even well paid engineers generally don't live close to where they work because they can't afford it. But that area is one of the largest internet hubs in the world, because the location is geographically good for traffic coming from overseas.

Edit: I actually had to look up Lehi. That one hasn't ever really been on my radar, but I actually do know several people who were laid off from a job I had before moving here (I jumped ship before it happened), who all work at a startup based out of there. But it's a fully remote company so they are all spread out across the country.



  - Current Boston Resident here, been living here now for work over 4 1/2 years now. If you are looking to buy a house good luck!!! There is nothing that is afforable here at all, traffic is only going to get worse, I work as a Sales Engineer (Hybrid) in the Semiconductor space, but had enough of the city. The only thing keeping me here is my long term relationship with my girlfriend as her family lives here. Boston is only going to get more expensive as even more housing like in the outskirts of Worcester/Woburn/Springfield, and even the home prices in Brockton (the getto) have gone up! I would stay away from Boston at all cost, it is becoming a mini New York City! Look at Providence, RI or the south for career opportunities they are upcoming (most of the south is in the field of GovTech). Any recommendations from the chat to know about North/South Carolina? Looking for tech hubs in North Carolina!!!!!!!





research triangle sounds like silicon valley, but possibly even worse..??

https://www.reddit.com/r/SameGrassButGreener/comments/1df49h9/where_would_you_rather_live_north_carolina_in_the/
  - Yes. I've been stuck in Raleigh a few years and hate it. I honestly don't see why people are moving here. It offers nothing to justify the cost of housing. Housing in Richmond is more affordable, and IMO Richmond's a better place to live.

  - It's all boring, generic, homogeneous car-dependent suburban sprawl. 7-8 years ago, it was at least affordable, now it's not even that. It offers nothing to justify the cost of housing. There are plenty of real cities and suburbs of real cities with a lot more to offer that have the same or less expensive cost of living.

  - Also the people are flat NPCS in most places here. Like theirs really no charm or local spice. The dating scene is pretty bland....The bar scene is alright....For a place filled with younger millennials and tech implants it really has no pulse. Most people haven't travelled out of a 15 mile radius some somehow someway you'll feel like you're living in a smaller or midsize suburbs as you will run into these people everywhere. The roads can be a bit hard to navigate and haven't not been updated to fit current traffic needs in most cases,

  - I work for a large tech company, not FAANG. Moved here from Denver last year. Tbh, I wouldn’t recommend it for the job market…bay area and pnw companies view engineers as their bread and butter and pay accordingly. Companies here do not seem to view us as anything other than cost centers, with minor exceptions. Still a tough job market. On top of that, the weather is brutal during summer.

  - Oh boy, you’re in for a surprise. The people are just as awful as they are everywhere else. Consistently ranked high for best places for business and oddly enough worst places for workers.

  - The Triangle has more biotech than "traditional" tech companies. I don't understand why you would move to a state with a mostly republican population, lower paying jobs, fewer jobs in general, worse food, worse nature, less culture, objectively the WORST state for workers, AND you would have to pay state taxes. Raleigh/Charlotte is cheaper than Seattle, but housing costs have skyrocketed in the last couple of years.

  - Yes. I've been stuck in Raleigh a few years and hate it. I honestly don't see why people are moving here. It offers nothing to justify the cost of housing. Housing in Richmond is more affordable, and IMO Richmond's a better place to live.

  - I lived in Raleigh for 6+ years. It was by far my most hated place to live out of 7 states.

  - God, glad to seem I'm no the only one to hate it here. 20 out of 25 years here and miserable here (don't ask why I'm back here)







west NC not so ideal after all..

https://www.reddit.com/r/SameGrassButGreener/comments/16ly8z9/a_note_about_the_north_carolina_mountains/

  - It depends on what you're looking for tbh. If you give zero fucks about politics, good food, arts/entertianment/culture, schools/children's welfare, legal weed, buying booze on Sundays, walkability, having stable rents, or contributing to the local community, then NC might be for you. If literally all you care about is buying a modest SFH for 400-500k, not having snow in the winter, and you already have a WFH job, then NC could be great. But if you care at all about anything else I mentioned or if you need a job locally, then you should really think about the pros and cons of being in NC.

    So many people think they can get a cheap 4/3 suburban home with great schools in a liberal walkable neighborhood like you can in other places. You aren't getting that anywhere in NC.

    Tennessee has a lot of the same things as NC, but they have no state taxes. I'm from NC but spent a few years living in CT, I think CT and all of New England is super underrated. My quality of life and income was much better in CT than NC . Pittsburgh is kind of gross imo but it's relatively cheap and urban. Philly is sketch AF in some areas, but some of the nicer neighborhoods are REALLY NICE. Chicago is cheap AF for how urban it is of you're willing to tolerate the winters and can find a nice neighborhood. Denver is expensive AF like Asheville but has way more opportunity. Cincy and Cleveland have nice AF condos downtown, but then you're living in Ohio.

  - If you're an average person with an average job, the entire state of NC is really not great to live. Wages here are low, no unions, unemployment benefits are super low, no guaranteed sick time, super easy to get fired, etc.

    Businesses keep on moving to NC because it's cheap to operate here, which means it's easier/cheaper to exploit your employees.

    However, if you're a tech worker with a company based out of the West Coast and can move out here, you can live pretty well. But what the hell are you going to do if you get laid off? (I argue that people doing this are a part of the problem here in NC and other sunbelt cities, but also, I can't really blame them either)
