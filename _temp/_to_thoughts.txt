in LA:
LA is a hell-hole. Vapid. America stuck in the 60s: cars, burger joints, highways, people spending 2-4 hours in commute. It's so bad that i yearn for NorCal: SF, Santa Cruz, even Berkeley. All are better, much better: refined, more conscious, more earthy--natural, mind on and values the important things, more yin, less yang.

SGV is Virginia Beach, without seasons: strip malls with Asian restaurants, corporate franchises, single-family surburban homes, beaches a distant and traffic-laden highway ride or a drug 'n crime ridden light rail train away. Only the addition of mountains make it differ. Just replace Norfolk with LA. It ain't much different.

In LA, particularly Koreatown and SGV, small businesses startup on blocks with a strip mall and a parking lot. It's ugly, requires a bus ride or personal transport along a busy road. Smaller businesss can negotiate with the owner of the block if they can vend food on the block, or, otherwise, vend on a public street.

The noise of traffic around Koreatown, and the "city" area of LA in general, reminds me of Taipei. Coming from a very quiet residential area in Berkeley, it's  a drastic change. However, unlike Taipei, it doesn't have the narrow alleys, cute three-story residential neighborhoods, street businesses, temples, street markets, culture. It's mostly corporate, full of dull fast-food franchises. Something to pass, like Ventura CA.

Dreams of working in a NSX-like place, a flower in the city, a hope, a sanctuary, a sane place, a sane way to live in such an insane place and culture. I also dream of working at a vegan Asian restaurant. Those are the only two ways i see out of this hell-hole.

Maybe a ride up the mountain for now... a minor escape. Maybe encounter some Chinese hikers.

Maybe there's a Taiwanese temple somewhere..

Maybe there's peace and hope somewhere.

Or maybe it's within me.
