heya.

i'm at a point in life where i'm coming back to America, specifically California, for the sole purpose of doing career-related work. I recently finished my trip exploring the coast of Cali by scooter(!!) and now am in San Diego/Baja Cali while i ponder upon some mid-life career directions..

i've been out of the tech world for some time, but recently, during my off-time while working at UC Berkeley (not tech-related), with just an old chromebook at hand, i discovered some newfound joy in computers again while searching for tools to make making games, gui apps, web apps more enjoyable (and i found them!: ruby/dragonruby, haxeui/haxe, elixir/phoenix). The journey led me through a history of programming languages, linux, unix/terminals/shells, all the way back to the beginning with lisp/emacs 'n smalltalk'! It was a fun blast through the past. So now i'm trying to transition towards more generalist IT jobs like sys admin/devops, or specialize in data visualization, as i feel it overlaps with making video games, and would be really fulfilling to help others visualize data.

this job interests me because it mixes the visualization and interactivity of games with reality, real data. I feel i'd LOVE making little tools, scripts, 'n apps for researchers/scientists in order to fill the gap of accessibility for visualizing data, a sort of "creative-coding" tool-set, similar to the gap that processing/p5.js and openframeworks filled in the past for "creative tech"/"new media" artists. Making simple cli/gui/web apps to scrape, ETL, then visualize data sounds sooo satisfying. Data then could be visualized via standard scientific plot/graph libs, p5.js, d3.js, or maybe even simple game engines! Wow, i'm actually excited..! I feel like there's just so much that can be done in this area.. Not just ancient plots 'n graphs used in academic papers, but the infinite ways to visualize through 2d and 3d graphics. It'd be like empowering people to make little games, but with data from reality! :) Finally, maybe all the time i spent looking for 2d game engines with good drawing apis 'n good performance will have a practical use! It would be sooo fun helping others visualize data in different ways, and even prototyping some ideas with my favorite game engines!! What a dream!!!

beyond the inital few pro tech jobs i did in ~2011-2013, most of my tech experience came from my passion for making games (including video games). As it only requires pure systems programming, i lack the contemporary large-scale web app pro work experience to compete in today's market, especially in the SF Bay Area: js frameworks (client and server), cloud computing / container orchestration, language modelling, software for massive scale. Therefore i honestly have little to no hope to even land a software job. Most recruiters just don't care about game-making, and for web apps i used frameworks fit for a solo dev: asp.net profesionally, rails for a tiny moment, and now am trying phoenix personally. None of these skills seem to translate to contemporary js stuff. :/

my experience with the tech qualifications listed is all over the place. I used ruby via dragonruby, a game engine and mruby fork, and jekyll. I used python to make a web server for college. I used t-sql(?) for an asp.net job, mysql to make a web forum for college, and now i'm using postgres for small phoenix web apps. Only the asp.net web app had a big database, but not petabytes big. I don't have experience with workflow engines, nor data modeling/integration/warehousing. Though, they just seem like fancy synonyms for ETL..??

the most relevant experience i have was my first tech job, which simply scheduled sending data from various old real-estate software to web services (the old asp.net rpc). My main task was to decipher the databases of the legacy software, write a giant query to retreive precisely what was needed, and clean 'n cast the data type correctly. The app then went on to make whatever reports 'n visuals out of the data. Not very interesting.. but i'm hoping it could be more fun with biology visualizations, and more light-weight feeling with go/ruby/python instead of C#..

my nature prefers the chaos of talking and supporting everyone in a community, whilst doing several tasks on several projects on my own, learning and doing a bit of everything. I think i'd be satisfied working at a small media production or startup where it's very DIY and where everyone does everything, but for big institutions like this, i believe i could find a home within a department, supporting everyone with tech stuff. The Data Library website is actually great,

anyway, please just e-mail me, as i'll be getting another phone in Mexico!
