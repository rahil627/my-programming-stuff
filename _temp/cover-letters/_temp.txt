NYC was my school!


one time, while travelling, a friend put me on to some philosophical audiobook courses. It was then, i understood there was something different in the way i process information. Some time after that, i discovered Voice Dream Reader, a sort of e-book reader that came with a few now-roboty-voiced "voices", a very good 'n simple app, targeted at people with dyslexia. I was able to read, really read. And i read a lot. I don't think i'm dyslexic, though i was "hooked on phonics" at age 5 and did poor in English courses. I'm a visual person. But, i think there's something deep about the experience of audio, over text. Besides, with all this stupid AI crap going on, this is one of the few areas i feel AI is actually a good application.


not hard, but, more time-constraining, my short time in NYC was hectic, running around and putting up video game art installations, in which code can be written in anything, usually a mess, in code and physically, with jumbled electronic circuits, alt controllers, arcade cabinets, all literally held together by velcro.. we just had to do whatever to make things work for the event. Well, i guess it wasn't that hard, because the artists of NYC are so empowering to be with.. ;)
