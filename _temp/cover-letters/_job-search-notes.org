see goals in [uni-job-search]
- UPDATE: *FORGET about university jobs, switch to private jobs*
  - unis are too slow, too bureaucratic, too fake, like governments
  - *AIM FOR SUPPORT ENGINEER AT SMALL STARTUPS*
    -> then slowly learn and do everything as needed
  - and use whatever tech they use!
    - see [tools...]
    - web startups: ruby/rails, elixir/phoenix, js/react, js/node
    - ai/ml startups: python
    - orrrrrr, maybe not.. *just do some real systems programming via jai making games*
  -> *make a few friends here, and stick to them for work, create a team*
    - *FIND SAM!!*
      - *only he could mentor me through the mess of contemporary tech..*
- *otta.com seems really good.. stick to that!*
  - can fallback to the other one..
- try discord and twitch again (game social tools)
  - discord is primarily js/node, i think.. though with a good amount of elixir for sure..

* TODO resume
- get another domain
  - update server addresses on github pages
- update resume on jobs i applied to
  - TODO: can only update on stanford's system
- just update resume
  - pass it through some automated resume checker thing (to see how well it parses)
  - rewrite the babycastles portion
    - add videos
  - add a photo?


* TODO merged from elsewhere
https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/16u6kbn/would_you_ever_leave_the_gaming_industry_and_work/


* which cog in a big company?

*NOTE: gitlab recruits world-wise, so the competition is impossible*
  - https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/
    - possibly the largest all-remote company.. at just ~3000 workers

gitlab is a really good source to figure out which job/role in a big company fits you best..

potential paths:
1. support engineer -> product designer -> product manager
  - probably the only path i could tolerate for a long period of time..
2. support engineer -> devops engineer? (+ai/python +back-end web?/ruby!) -> systems engineer

https://about.gitlab.com/jobs/all-jobs/
  - positions not listed still show under the joining the talent pool
    - product
      - (product manager)
      - product designer!
      - technical writer
      - user experience researcher

https://handbook.gitlab.com
  - *VERY WELL DOCUMENTED, tells how each job is, including internal tools, external tools (apps), and even useful browser extensions*
  - very good knowledge/tool sharing!

    - mostly little macos date/time tools..

  
https://about.gitlab.com/blog/what-its-like-to-interview-at-gitlab/
  
  - gitlab
    - associate support engineer <-- STARTING-POINT
      -> support engineer
        - https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/support/engineering/
          - "As a Support Engineer at GitLab, the majority of your time will be focused on helping customers solve problems. This happens mostly through tickets, but can also happen through issues, screen sharing calls, and emergencies."
        -> assigned support engineer
        -> manager, support engineering
    - potential paths:
      - this is a really good way to see which jobs fits, as it's in ruby/rails..
    - *product manager*
      - obviously, the most fitting/ideal, as it's just a bunch of communication!
        - see the activity of this senior product manager
          - https://gitlab.com/users/dashaadu/activity
      - Senior Product Manager, Dedicated (the paid version)
      - Senior Product Manager, Plan
    - *devops engineering*
      - not as broad as i hoped.. but who knows, this is a humongous rails app..!
      - intermediate backend engineer (ruby on rails), plan: knowledge
        - hmmm, seems to be mostly graphql/query/db/redis stuff.. maybe too specific..
      - even the ci functions / go lang devops job sounds better.., as it's just plain programming..
      - intermediate backend engineer (ruby), plan: project management
        - doesn't seem too different.. though more power/managerial than just queries, handling a whole feature (the planning workflow)
    - *ai engi*
      - surprisingly, along with web, the most interesting one!
      - Intermediate Backend Engineer (Ruby), AI Engineering, Custom Models
      - Intermediate Fullstack Engineer (TypeScript), AI Engineering: Editor Extensions – Multi-Platform
      - Senior Backend Engineer (Python), AI Engineering: Agent Foundations
      - Staff Backend Engineer, AI Engineering: Code Creation (Ruby and Python)
        - very interesting
      - Staff Fullstack Engineer (Python/Vue.js), AI Engineering: Duo Chat
        - probably also interesting..
        - https://about.gitlab.com/blog/gitlab-duo-chat-gets-agentic-ai-makeover/
          - TODO: see video of workflow here..
    - sec engi?

    - data engi?
      - nope, not from those titles!

* $$$ tools and their main uses in the working world

  - *FOCUS ON THESE!!*

  - hmmm, yeah.. *i'd much rather stick to ruby/rails and elixir/phoenix for web, in addition to python for data sci.. that should cover enough of the startup world..*
    - leave the java and C# stuff for the big business apps: *stay nimble 'n scrappy!*
    - forget about low-level/systems dev for now too
      - can always do C/C++/jai when it comes
    - fuck mobile

  - because my aim is to continue to make stuff, mostly on my own, these skills seem to overlap well with the skills needed for founding engineer jobs within early startups!

  - *master CRUD web apps and data-sci*
    -> *more complex web-gui* (react and live-view)

** main tools
  1. linux
     - *nearly all servers*
       - microsoft is the exception
       - TODO: ask about most popular distros for server use
         - rocky? debian? opensuse?
     - *systems admin tools*
       - distributed computing
       - config management
       - networking
       - task schedulers
     - *devops tools*
       - server orchestration/deployment
       - containerization
       - ci/cd

  2. *python*
     - data science (ai/ml/big data/computation)
       - *ai/ml startups (pytorch, etc.)*
       - *academic research (numpy, jupytr notebooks, etc.)*
     - ansible (orchestration?)
     - *simple enough to rememeber the whole langauge*

  3. *ruby*
     - *web startups (rails)*
       - it seems there still aren't many phoenix/elixir jobs.. (2025)
       - *and ruby still seems to be thriving..!*
         - there's a TON of sites made in ruby..
           - *could even work multiple jobs!!*
     - *niche enough to have a smaller/tighter-knit community of devs/makers*, especially among startups
     -> dragonruby

  4. *elixir*
     - *web startups alt (phoenix)*
       - very few..
       - *still can use personally, as it's still web dev experience..*, especially tailwindcss, postgresql, etc.
     - try/understand functional paradigm

  5. *javascript*
     - web
       - *react*
         - all contemporary web rely on this, or try to get around it (htmx, elm?, phoenix liveview, razor components?, etc.)
       - thankfully replaces mobile dev tools

  6. *c* > *jai* > *c++*
     - high performance bits / optimization
       - *via C/C++? extensions for python and ruby*
     - embedded devices
       - not my jam
     -> *jon blow's engine*
     -> *game optimization*

** no personal use / for a solo-maker
  OKAY (haxe? == nim >= ocaml >>>) go
     - high performance bits / optimization (via concurrency)
       - but without resorting to manual-memory management nor borrow-checker
       - not sure if haxe has concurrency nor build tools as good as go's though..
     - nothing to really learn here.. just concurrency..??
       - and the zen of procedural programming
     - *better off sticking to haxe..*
     -> (*no personal use cases* for go)

  NO rust
     - high performance, memory-safe bits
     - *too much to learn*, given that i already have the above languages and frameworks to master..
       - leave this to the systems devs
     - (great lang and maintainer tho..)
     -> (*no personal use cases*)

  OKAY clr (c#, f#)
    - large organizations: businesses, corporations, ngo
    - web (asp.net/core: entity, razor, blazor?)
    - *feels walled off to microsoft's land/way (gui tools, etc.), as opposed to the more scrappy open-source/linux way*
    -> *unity*, fna/monogame
      - *unity does have the best platform support / porting tho..*
    -> (*no personal use cases*)

  NO jvm (clojure, scala, kotlin, java, haxe! :D)
    - very large organizations: businesses, military, research, gov, etc.
    - web (spring boot??)
    - *mobile (android)*
      - this is one great benefit of using the jvm world..
    - surely solid, but *not a fun langauge, with the exception of clojure and possibly scala*
      - TODO: is scala mainly functional-oriented?
    -> (*no personal use cases*)

  NO swift and obj-c
    - HELL NO

      - has a new job matching app
        - TODO: finish profile
      - co-founder..? meh :/
    - *remoteok*
      - must be super competitive..
    - wellfound (angellist)
      - looks legit, it's just that.. the startups seems so boring.. :/


** niche programming language related sites/discord/matrix/etc.
  - ruby/elixir jobs
    - *https://usingrails.com/*
      - nice!!
      - *incredible amount of rails jobs.. wow..!*
        - *ruby is _NOT_ dead*
    - *rubyonremote.com*
      - https://rubyonremote.com/remote-jobs-in-us/
        - look for junior positions
          - filter may not be so good..
    - https://elixirjobs.net/
      - very very few listed, and all except the first page is outdated, though, a good source to see which companies use it..
      - TODO: just make a few sites with phoenix/elixir, then can apply to these!! :D
      - relabs
        - a design studio job!!



** general sites
  - otta.com
    - seems very good so far..
    - recommends you jobs based on a few preferences/filters
      - go through ~10 per session
      - directly apply to the site
      - generates info about the company
  - levels.fyi
    - TODO: try some more..
    - seems to aggregate from the same boring big company sources, nothing deep
    - but does provide a very good filter system, possibly easy to scrape..
  - linkedin
    - sounds like the most useful nowadays..
      - seems like the aggregators catch these... nothing special..??
    - clicking apply doesn't mean you apply through linked it, it usually just goes to the company's website's software
    - it found and re-activated my old account..?
      - TODO: finish profile..
        - no need to even fill out a profile, for most jobs, you must apply through their own website
    - craigslist
      - only the true gangstas use this
    - indeed
      - meh, though people do say it works..??

  - game studios
    - *workwithindies*
      - TODO: keep an eye out for ui/ux design
    - gamejobs.co
      - lots of big companies.. :/

  - design studios/agencies
    - TODO: ??


* job titles

path: support engineer (+ customer support) -> support dev + tools dev + dev-ops + sys-admin + design/ui/ux (*everything*)
  - *in a small startup, you eventually just do everything*

    - just *START AS A SUPPORT ENGINEER FOR A SMALL STARTUP, and slowly creep into doing everything else, as needed*

** designer
  - *game ui/ux designer*
    - sounds even more satisfying than even design studio work, as i could really spend time honing, perfecting ui/ux design/controls
    - *probably the most fitting job for my nature*
      - very niche too..
      - i don't understand how jblow mastered this AND programming!

  - product designer (+ ui/ux) for a design studio
    - *corporate contracts may get tangled with dirty ethics..*

  - product designer (+ ui/ux) for a web/mobile app
    - *way too fucking lame*
    - might get fed up with evil/money-oriented/quantitative management..

** NO manager
  - product manager
    - lots of managing..
      - i'm not a manager..
        - *don't need a manager, just need a skilled maker that can guide a team*
          - sam is great at this..
          - *by the time this position exists, the company is too big*
            - *need small startup teams with flat hierarchies*, no more

** dev
  - [see tools]
    - basically: web, data-sci, systems/embedded, mobile
      - i think i'd only be able to tolerate *web (server) and data-sci*
        - also, *as a solo maker, those should be my only focuses*, mobile and systems/embedded are for specific cases

*** research
  - *research software engineer*
    - (at research universities)
    - write software to enable researchers to further their research
      - *mostly python* data-science stuff, and some R
        - have a ton of data to store, manipulate, etc.
    - assist non-programming researchers on their research projects
      - *can be several projects, short-term, varying*
    - *teach everyone the ways of programming*
      - this is a good skill to have, and fun!: teaching
    - *benefits of being at a research university..*

  - visualization engineer? (for data-sci)
    - seems quite rare..
    - sounds closest to game programming in the big-org tech world.. but maybe not so fun after all.. as it's still just data-sci

** support
  - support engineer/dev:
    - *support engineer*
      - *sounds like an ideal job for me, especially for starting*: less responsiblity, easily replaceable, quite generalist, usually starts from bugs/"traige", works from outside-in, from design (talking to customers) to programming (software problems, design problems), don't have to deeply care about the product so much (like a product designer/manager)
    - *dev-ops?*
      - seems to be a specific set of systems dev skills for deploying web apps..:
        - in order:
        - build/make
        - continuous integration/delivery (github actions/ci, gitlab)
        - containerization (docker, etc.)
        - server orchestration (kubernetes, etc.)
    - *tools engineer*
      - make in-house tools for devs (and the rest of the company?)
        - *a solo maker job!!*
      - this sounds quite *autonomous*, and awesome!

  - customer support:
    - *dev customer service*
      - (for products that are for developers)
    - technical customer service
    - technical customer success
    - solutions engineer
      - set-up and tailor product for each client/customer
    - sales engagement?
      - more social

** sys-admin
  - *systems/server admin(istrator)*
    - *among the most generalist-skilled jobs*
      - tons of superficial knowledge/experience
        - *linux-lovers have me beat here..*
    - linux
      - file systems
      - set-up for multiple users
    - networking
    - distributed computing (on prem, cloud, hpc)
      - on prem: vmware, etc.
      - cloud: aws, gcp, etc.
      - hpc: slurm
    - config management (ansible, etc.)
    - windows: active directory and azure
    - [see devops]


  - *IT?*
    - seems to be a pop term for systems admins..?


* ycombinator startup funding
  - very easy to apply!
    - just send an idea, even if it's the "late deadline"i
      - DONE
        - ..DAMN!
    - seems to prefer having a co-founder.. :/
      - maybe can ask Sam
        - yeah, he would be perfect!! and he lives in SF!



* remote jobs
  - remote companies
    - wikimedia (wikipedia)
      - *todo: software engineer for the content transform team*
      - movement communications specialist, product and tech
    - duolingo
    - gitlab
      - see entry under ruby contributors
      - support engineer (worldwide/remote)
      - TODO: others jobs??


* NO schools
  - *both universities and schools mostly use outdated enterprise software, which doesn't look fun maintaining..*
    - drupal (a php cms)
      - this allows departments, research labs, research centers, etc. to build their own sites, yet be managed by a centralized IT unit
    - departments that need a computer person can be fulfilling, as one can be in control of all the software for that department (sys-admin), choosing what one likes, integrating stuff (n8n), making one's own, and also *the social aspect of getting to know everyone*
      - actually, wanting to be a part of the department/organization should be the main reason to be there: *choose a department you want to be in* (i.e. *UCSC engineering*, *USC game/film*, NYU game/itp, parson's design 'n tech, etc.)
        - see [master's schools]
    - notes on learning management software (LMS)
      - *canvas uses ruby*
      - moodle uses php
    - *main problem is that you have to live near the campus, pay those costs, be near transient people*
      - however, *it could feel like a youth hostel, filled with people with good intentions..*
      - *rarely ever has remote work, even for IT/tech jobs*
    
** lower ed
  - 1. edjoin.org
    - *less competitive than university jobs*
    - *possibly same pay but in a lower cost-of-living area*
    - *likely more freedom, power, responsibility*
    - could be a cushy job..

  - schooljobs/govermentjobs.com
    - may have to apply through here

  - district job boards

** NO higher ed
    - see [uni job search]

    - must apply directly
      - and the process can be a pain, requiring to add work history, etc.

    - less competitive than FAANG and many private jobs
      - still likely has many goodie asians applying..
    - *very slow application process ;(*
    - *very bureacratic*
      - *especially public/gov-funded ones*
        - *all built around STEM funding*
    - *can take some classes: EMT, languages, tech, bootcamps, etc.*
      - MAYBE, if they somehow make time for it..
    - *can participate in research / labs* during off-time, at least..
      - can build a network in specific interests
        - *but probably very slow and far behind private startups..*
          - *STARTUPS ARE GRASSROOTED BUSINESSES!*
            - *STICK TO THE CITIES*
              - *SF then Hawaii or Taiwan or NYC*

* NO FAANG (unless microsoft has an office beyond washington..)
x/google
  - helps government do evil things
    - wikileaks
    - contributes to genocide
      - isreal "defence" project nimbus
  - products are in a massive graveyard, abandoned, forgetten, without a sense of design, though pragmatic
  - responsible for spreading simple programming languages: python > ruby, dart > haxe, go > any garbage-collected lang
x/amazon
  - products are ALL GARBAGE copies of pop consumer devices (kindle, fireTV, alexa, luna [Google stadia], echo frames?, etc.)
  - mostly web cloud server stuff
x/facebook?
  - ew! just has vr (meta quest)
  - bought instagram.. quite late tho..
x/apple
  - is closed off
nvidia
  - actually don't know much about it..
  - but surely mostly hardware work, except firmware..??
*microsoft*
  - hmmm, not in FAANG..?? *what's the N? netflix??*
    - maybe nvidia..
  - *the clear winner*
  - *hq location sucks tho..*
    - bellevue, washington (state) (near seattle)

      - but then limited to C#, which i'm not really interested either for games or web.. i prefer jai/C/ruby/elixir/dragonruby (language and engine) and rails 'n phoenix
      - likely an overtly complex VM (same route as java)... not that ruby's isn't, but ruby has good reason: for it's syntax and features
    - xbox
      - might as well just buy a gaming laptop nowadays..
      - hasn't made a good game since halo 2..? ..lol.. yikes!
      *- the original xbox live arcade was the nicest for indie devs, though still a pain..*
        - though.. *now, it's the switch*
        - providing the XNA framework was kind too
    - surface pro actually has potential
      - ..though it took a very very long time to catch up to Apple..
    - *is okay with hiring indians, and allowing them up the ladder, up to level of CEO :)*
