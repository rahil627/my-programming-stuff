    - TODO: *should make a free work-exchange site (workaway, helpx), hostel booking site (hostelbookers), and a hostel volunteer site (worldpackers)*
  - watsi
    - fund healthcare for people in need around the world
    - no careers site, just an old job posted on their blog
      - i still sent a short e-mail
  - *weedmaps*
    - !!!
    - this is a great example of a store i could easily maintain..
    - just sent a short e-mail
    - TODO: *should make the best weed strain site, alcohol site, cooking site*




* job titles:
  - in general, aim for *early startups/pursuits with friends*


  - *game ui/ux designer*
    - sounds even more satisfying than even design studio work, as i could really spend time honing, perfecting ui/ux design/controls
    - *probably the most fitting job for my nature*
      - very niche too..
      - i don't understand how jblow mastered this AND programming!

  - *product designer*
    - might get fed up with bad, money-oriented/quantitative management..

  - *product manager*

  - others:

  - research software engineer
    - at universities
    - write software to enable researchers to further their research
    - assist on non-programming researchers on their research projects
      - *can be several projects, short-term, varying*
    - teach everyone the ways of programming

  - visualization?
    - sounds closest to game programming in the corporate tech world.. but maybe not so fun after all..
    - requires a lot of SQL :/

  - technical customer service
  - technical customer success
  - solutions engineer
  - sales engagement?
    - more social

  - systems/server admin(istrator)?
  - IT?
  - devops?
    - more unix, generalist, terminals (emacs?)!

** jobs to practice the craft of programming:
- *plenty of these are founding engineer jobs within early startups*
- web product startup jobs using the following tech:
  - *phoenix/elixir*
    - built-in gradual typing coming soon!
    - live-view-native in dev!
  - *rails*
    - it seems there still aren't many phoenix/elixir jobs.. (2025)
      - *and ruby still seems to be thriving..!*
    - for the <3 of ruby
  - asp.net
    - meh, i much prefer phoenix/elixir, and still even prefer rails/ruby for community reasons, especially for their smaller communities, though, this is probably better than ruby for big code-bases




* ycombinator startup funding
  - very easy to apply!
    - just send an idea, even if it's the "late deadline"i
      - DONE
        - ..DAMN!
    - seems to prefer having a co-founder.. :/
      - maybe can ask Sam
        - yeah, he would be perfect!! and he lives in SF!


* job sites list

  - through friends
  
  - direct

  - general sites
  - levels.fyi
    - TODO: try some more..
    - seems to aggregate from the same boring big company sources, nothing deep
    - but does provide a very good filter system, possibly easy to scrape..
  - linkedin
    - sounds like the most useful nowadays..
      - seems like the aggregators catch these... nothing special..??
    - clicking apply doesn't mean you apply through linked it, it usually just goes to the company's website's software
    - it found and re-activated my old account..?
      - TODO: finish profile..
        - no need to even fill out a profile, for most jobs, you must apply through their own website
    - craigslist
      - only the true gangstas use this
    - indeed
      - meh, though people do say it works..??

  - game studios
    - *workwithindies*
      - TODO: keep an eye out for ui/ux design
    - gamejobs.co
      - lots of big companies.. :/

  - design studios/agencies

  - ruby/elixir jobs
    - *https://usingrails.com/*
      - nice!!
      - *incredible amount of rails jobs.. wow..!*
        - *ruby is _NOT_ dead*
    - *rubyonremote.com*
      - https://rubyonremote.com/remote-jobs-in-us/
        - look for junior positions
          - filter may not be so good..
    - https://elixirjobs.net/
      - very very few listed, and all except the first page is outdated, though, a good source to see which companies use it..
      - TODO: just make a few sites with phoenix/elixir, then can apply to these!! :D
      - relabs
        - a design studio job!!


  - startups
    - just *live in SF*
      - *nahhh... no sense of home ;( gotta try to make LA/SGV/LB my home.. build from the heart*
    - *ycombinator*
      - the OG
      - *hnhiring*

        - TODO: finish profile
      - co-founder..? meh :/
    - *remoteok*
      - must be super competitive..
    - wellfound (angellist)
      - looks legit, it's just that.. the startups seems so boring.. :/


* tools:
  - ruby (rails, roda, sinatra) > python
    -> *dragonruby*
  - *c* > *jai* > rust > c++
  - elixir (phoenix)
  - c# (asp.net)
    -> unity, fna/monogame

* remote jobs

      - movement communications specialist, product and tech
    - duolingo
    - gitlab
      - see entry under ruby contributors
      - support engineer (worldwide/remote)
      - TODO: others jobs??

* schools
  - both universities and schools mostly use outdated enterprise software, which doesn't look fun
    - departments that need a computer person can be fulfilling, as one can be in control of all the software for that department, choosing what one likes, integrating stuff (n8n), making one's own, and also *the social aspect of getting to know everyone*
      - actually, wanting to be a part of the department/organization shouold be the main reason to be there: *choose a department you want to be in* (i.e. UCSC game/film, NYU game/itp, parson's design 'n tech, etc.)
    - notes on learning management software (LMS)
      - *canvas uses ruby*
      - moodle uses php, yikes
    - *main problem is that you have to live near the campus, pay those costs, be near transient people*
      - however, *it could feel like a youth hostel, filled with people with good intentions*
    

  - 1. edjoin.org
    - less competitive than university jobs, possibly same pay but in a lower cost-of-living area
  - schooljobs/govermentjobs.com
    - may have to apply through here
  - district job boards

  - universities
    - less competitive than FAANG and many private jobs
      - still likely has many goodie asians applying..
    - can take some classes, do EMT, etc.

    - https://www.niche.com/colleges/search/best-colleges/s/california/

    - ordered by my desire

    - USC
      - private
      - *top film and game programs*
        - #2 in design school in the country? (by niche)
      - closer to DTLA, making it centrally accessible, but undesirable location to live near..
    - art center
      - seems to be more vocational art tech: graphic design, cinematography, animation, etc.
      - *game, film, etc. arts*
        - in the future, can try game and entertainment design support teaching jobs
      - *pasadena*
    - caltech
      - would be impossible to compete for a tech job here..!
      - small, ~2000 students, thus among the most selective, a top 10 super research college
      - *pasadena/SGV!! perfect location*


    - minerva
      - *travel and learn on your own time, auto-didacts*
        - *now this is how i'd build my school!!*
      - ~1000 students
      - SF for the US portion
        - will be close to the startup scene
    - stanford
      - bay area / silicon valley network
      - *TODO: should try this out..*, since i didn't like the public school organization (UC Berkeley)
    - claremont colleges
      - *top undergraduate liberal arts college in the country*, alongside stanford
        - *the sort i belong in*
      - added two graduate schools (5Cs -> 7Cs), but i think it's mostly medicine related..
      - isolated, further east of SGV, very white/culture-less around the college
      - https://www.hmc.edu/human-resources/employment-at-harvey-mudd/employment-at-other-claremont-colleges/
        - each college is a seperate organization/business, and so each one has it's own employmeent site.. :/

    - UC
      - *LA* (big city) > *santa cruz*, *davis*, *santa barbara* (small-towns, nature) > berkeley, san diego, *irvine* >>>> riverside, merced
        - *UCLA is central to LA*, and i'd def fit in there as opposed to Berkeley!
        - *UCLA is also a top design school*, alongside USC, NYU, CMU, UPenn, etc.

favorite big tech:
  - many from SF
  - many started by y-combinator

*y-combinator*

*discord*
   - python, *elixir*, rust, react, *react-native*, electron
   - gamer culture
craigslist
  - advertises on craigslist ;)
wikipedia
  - php :/
*twitch*
  - rails!!
  - gamer culture
  - TODO: *should just be a streamer..*
    - *IN TAIWAN!! (for taiwan/chinese audience :D)*
      - permaculture life, playing games (game history, criticism, etc.), making games??, cooking!, selling in night markets!, hostel life?: *MY LIFE*
youtube
  - just solid tools, no agenda (not much at least..)
github
  - rails!

doordash
*etsy*
  - great for women 'n crafty people
  - php ;(

netflix?
  - *sold out* (sold their soul to the devil: marketing analytics)
  - trying to do game stuff
    - has game studios





* FAANG:
x/google's products are in a massive graveyard, abandoned, forgetten, without a sense of design, though pragmatic
x/amazon's products are ALL GARBAGE copies of pop consumer devices (kindle, fireTV, alexa, luna [Google stadia], echo frames?, etc.)
  - mostly web cloud server stuff
x/facebook? ew! just has vr (meta quest)
x/apple is closed off
*microsoft* is the clear winner
  - *good recent coop (or co-opt?) of open-source and linux stuff*
    - linux sub-shell
    - vs-code
    - typescript
    - .NET core
      - asp.net
        - blazor (web assembly), razor pages (mvc), razor components, etc.
    - C#
      - but then limited to C#, which i'm not really interested either for games or web.. i prefer jai/C/ruby/elixir/dragonruby (language and engine) and rails 'n phoenix
      - likely an overtly complex VM (same route as java)... not that ruby isn't, but ruby has good reason: for it's syntax and features
    - xbox
      - might as well just buy a gaming laptop nowadays..
      - hasn't made a good game since halo 2..?
      *- the original xbox live arcade was the nicest for indie devs, though still a pain..*
        - though, now, it's the switch
        - providing the XNA framework was kind too
    - surface pro actually has potential
