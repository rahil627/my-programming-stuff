my pro work history is very brief: my first tech job was a very ideal web software startup with just three others and an extremely neat .NET/ASP codebase long, long ago. As it was my first job, the problem i had with the job was that it required a very narrow focus for long periods of time, developing features which can take several months. It was sheer 9-10 hour software dev in a cubicle, no social life. The next job titled "QA & release engineer" was much more fitting as i was a sort of liason for the various tech 'n product teams in an office of about 50 people. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a dead-end job at a dystopian software company full of "crunching" and constant impossible deadlines (thus not in my resume). I haven't directly worked for another tech company since.
