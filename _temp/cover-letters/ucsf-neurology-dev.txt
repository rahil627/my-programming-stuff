heya.

i'm at a point in life where i'm coming back to America, specifically California, for the sole purpose of doing career-related work. I recently finished my trip exploring the coast of Cali (by scooter!) and now am in San Diego/Baja Cali while i ponder upon career directions as an older person.

i've been out of the tech world for some time, but recently, with just an old chromebook at hand, i discovered some newfound joy in computers again while searching for tools to make making games 'n apps more enjoyable (and i found them!: haxe/heaps, ruby/dragonruby, elixir/phoenix). The journey led me through programming languages, linux, unix/terminals/shells, scripting, all the way back to the beginning with emacs, lisp, 'n smalltalk! So now i feel i'm ready to transition back into tech.

my first tech job was a very ideal web software startup with just three others and an extremely neat .NET/ASP codebase long, long ago. As it was my first job, the problem i had with the job was that it required a very narrow focus for long periods of time, developing features which took several months. And i mean: sheer programming for 8-10 hours a day, for months on end. The next job titled "QA & release engineer" was far more simpler as i was a sort of liason for various tech 'n product teams in an office of <50 people. Unfortunately, it turned out to be the stereotype tech company with constant crunches for impossible deadlines (and thus is not in my resume). I haven't directly worked for another tech company since.

my nature prefers the communal chaos of talking and supporting everyone, whilst doing several tasks on several projects, learning and doing a bit of everything. I think i'd be satisfied working at small startups where it's very DIY and where everyone does everything.

though this job doesn't seem as broad as a systems admin one, it seems like one where products are made from beginning to end. It even seems entry-level, which is very rare, let alone within medicine. I think i'd like the niche of academic tech, where there's a lot of cool little research projects to work on, that often doesn't require the scale of massively distributed web apps. It sounds like a great niche to be in. Lastly, this job might feel more fulfilling, as it can be important / provide a meaningful impact to society. Though, i prefer and plan to try the EMT/paramedic route for that reason.

my later tech experience mostly dealt with small 'n artsy games, which only required pure systems programming, so i lack the contemporary large-scale web app pro work experience most jobs want (especially in SF): countless js frameworks, cloud computing / container orchestration, various software for massive scale. Thus, i'm only left with support roles and niche markets like this one. Luckily for me, a lot of medical software likely uses C and C++, which although i haven't used in a while (before it was "modern"), it's a skill that's still the standard for games and interactive media. And i'm guessing neurology simply uses python and julia (instead of matlab), which are totally fine.

having seen many job posts recently, this is a rare one that doesn't ask for much. The only qualification i'm missing is "course work on signal analysis and electrical engineering". It is a weak point of mine.. though, for the sake of making fun input devices for games, i do have some interest in it..!

the only things i'm hesitant about this job for is that it's very quantiative sciency and may feel like a hospital environment. I absolutely belong to the arts 'n humanities departments, with communities of more sensual people, where the more common sense taiwanese way of health and medicine prevails. I really hope the workplace isn't a brave new world. Luckily it's right there in the inner sunset.

the location of this job is quite special to me as it was the first place i moved to after leaving my home-town in VA: on 9th and geary, and later, on 18th and judah. I even used to study at the library up there, with the lush sofas 'n a panoramic view! I feel comfy moving back to west SF, especially now that i ride a motorcycle/bicycle (sorry 38 & N lines)! ..Ahhh, despite all its problems, i do miss SF!

anyway, please just e-mail me, as i'll be getting another phone in Mexico!
