i made a few little games with my friends long ago.. those designs were simple because the games were simple. That was the point(!): highly-accessible yet complex/competitive games, or just stupid party games. Then i quickly ventured into more physical designs via game installations, mostly focused on alternate controllers. I must have felt the problem isn't the content, but the actual physical interfaces: gamepads, keyboards, mice,  and now touch-screens (still severely under-used..). They all suck! Unfortunately, designing and making fun physical controls for games limited me to physical public spaces: museums, makerspaces, pizza shops. All of it is so... temporary. :(. Perhaps now i'm finally ready settle down for longer term things, like ux design in video games.. ;)


the process of learning to play from nothing is how i naturally think of things: from first principles, and if that somehow ties into education, *muah*! Jon Blow is indeed excellent at it (i'll def watch another 2 hour rant soon..). Anyway, it's just truly in my nature to tend to focus on, think about, design/improve/re-design user interfaces. From text editor design (doom-emacs, helix, focus) to game engine design (dragonruby, heaps, openFrameworks, custom) to language design (mruby, haxe, jai) to modular game tools like ldtk to tuning controls to controller design. All of it seems to matter to me, perhaps because all of it is a pain for me to use. But until this job post, i never knew a job for this existed! Crap! I missed a career path!! :(
