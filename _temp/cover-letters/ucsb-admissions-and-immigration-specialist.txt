heyo,

i was honestly just going to look for some yummy foreign-cuisine restaurant work around IV, but perhaps this job might be an easier start to such an expensive place!

the job honestly seems pretty menial, but as it deals with talking to folks from around the world, it might just be what i need, especially with such beautiful, bucolic, small-town surroundings! I've done a little visa stuff for my parent's motel business since i was kid, whom often hire immigrants (mostly from Africa and India..), and of course for some of my own family members, but it's certainly been too long, and surely things have changed since, especially now with you-know-who in charge.. Anyway, as i intend to immigrate myself, back, from the US to Asia, i just feel closer to such folks, my fellow refugees. :)

also, if there's room for some computer automation, i'll def be the one to find it, making this whole process as simple as possible for us all!

i'll be around town. I'm currently at SB, waiting for my scooter to get out of the shop--i didn't expect people to try to steal it on my second day here!.. After that, i'll either be in IV or LB, finally starting my life back in America the right way: near the ocean and mountains!

NOTE: i may or may not attend school starting next fall. It's either UCSC's computational media or something at National DongHua Uni in Taiwan, which just happens to be the only uni local to my region there, one that still has some grassroots feels to it (care about local ecology, native people, etc.). I'm really just hoping these smaller coastal Cali towns share a similar love for the land..
