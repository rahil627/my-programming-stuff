note: withdrew + re-applied

heyo,

i'm back in America, and ever since i've been back, the rest of the world has been burning in my mind--particularly rural Asia, where i've spent much time-- and more recently Nepal and Indonesia!--, and so, i've had a deep desire to be around an international community, especially one that is passionate about making practical impacts to the entire world--otherwise, i'd be back in my old little Mitsubishi van in Taiwan dealing with local grassroots org problems! :)

i was actually aiming for a computer person for a department sort of job (systems admin / general and research dev support), as i naturally tend to help people and concept 'n design solutions, yet also because i'd have the freedom to create or choose the neatest small solutions.. But perhaps it's time to update my [web] app dev skills, while replacing legacy cruft, with this job! I certainly don't mind a good port/re-write. It sounds like an ideal way to quickly make some stuff again, all-the-while cleaning up/re-factoring a big mess..

i loathe web dev, but i concede it's the main gui solution nowadays (beyond the limited situations for generated guis and immediate guis).. the current state of software is such a horrific mess.. :/

UPDATE: i noticed the uni uses drupal (cms), finally updating it from v7 to v10. I must say i have absolutely zero experience with drupal, which i've heard can get pretty complex at this size (a uni), despite it merely being a cms.. I first used Wordpress on my second personal web-site when i was in 9th or 10th grade (~2001-02??), but then reverted back my original plain html site from middle school; And though i had to make a featureful web forums site in php during my own uni course, it wasn't pretty.. Thus, if the uni runs on drupal (+salesforce +lms), and is trying to add some more to that world, or perhaps simply updating to v11, i am a very bad candidate for the job (--i personally don't even know what it's enterprise contenders are.. especially considering those well-tested integrations, as it's popular among large public orgs). I'm the one to say "the tech doesn't matter" as i have an artist's point-of-view, but this is an exceptional case where it may be nice to say you just need a large-org drupal/php wizard [considering time/money]. ;)

however, if for some reason the solution is a "monolithic" MVC web framework (any: C#/F#/entity, ruby/rails, elixir/phoenix, django/python, perhaps something more functional(?): scala, ocaml, haskell(??), whatever!), i'd def be down to give this a shot! That is the kind of web dev i'm accustomed to, as C#/ASP.NET was my first startup dev job, and as it feels a bit closer to the feel of systems programming: just a bit more.. wieldy.

anyway, just let me know.. i begin heading up the coast next week via motorcycle, stopping by campuses on my way (: usc, ucla, ucsb, possibly all the way up to santa cruz), escaping the desert that is the San Gabriel Valley. I've concluded my trip down Cali and am now certain, ready, and willing to work at any one of these great Cali institutions.. and just be happy to be back on the coast again, with some passionate people!


fyi: i'm thinking about doing the computational media MS program at UCSC next year (fall 2026). I don't know how long this job will take, but it's been extremely tough finding one, so i figured it's a good time to get another degree, as i have the opportunity to be in America again, and as there really isn't another program like it [here in Cali]. Though, UCSB does have a more artsy-tech program (MAT) with quite a few core i/o-related courses i'd love to take (: sensors, digital signals, computing with media, etc.), as i used to be into physical alt i/o games, and naturally create/design things based off understanding the boundaries of what's technically possible regarding inputs and outputs (and time-feasible as an individual). It would be awesome to sit in on that stuff!!

as i was lookin' at masters' programs, i glanced at the engineering research labs: of course misha sra's human-ai/hax lab is *the vibe*, but ben h.'s programming langauge lab and his research path is possibly also interesting [to me] too, as i'm quite into language design (i am always impressed by the tenacity of indie game devs to make/use their own languages: haxe, jai, dragonruby, wren), but going back to the hardware interface/ISA is a level i haven't even thought about going down to! Full circle, back to the 60s/70s. Perhaps it's finally time to make the smalltalk-game-engine-machine a reality!
