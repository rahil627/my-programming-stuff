heyo,

i'll try to keep this short: i'm actually aiming for computer person/admin of a department, particularly arts/humanities or researchers, but this one might be a relief, a bit more social, more walking around, technically easy, though, i'm afraid not much to automate or write programs/scripts for.. though it does mentions some "backup support" for the admins.. If this position involves more tight collaboration with the admins, i'd def be more interested, as i hope to glean some skills off them. ;)

i worked at UC Berkeley last summer, just as a temp "sr. custodian", but found it drab, as there was almost no life going on during the summer. Since then, i headed down the state of Cali. I'd be willing to give it a second chance during the shcool year, to really get a feeling of the campus life.

anyway, just let me know.. ucb surely has more than enough computer folks to fill this role.. maybe it can even be separated part-time to support the livelihoods of several students..?
