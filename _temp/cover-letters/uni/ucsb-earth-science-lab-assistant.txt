heyo,

i'll be headin up the coast soon, likely stopping at ucsb for the winter, so i figured i might as well apply to some jobs there, as i've the got the feeling that the tech job i'm aiming for, support dev / systems admin, may just be a dream now.. Additionally, the research labs there surely have all i'd ever want (particularly the i/o-based courses of the media, tech, arts program). I'm planning to lay low, possibly apply for the computational media master's at ucsc next year, so anything to get by until then will be fine for me..!

honestly, this job sounds like a blast from the past: sceince field trips to gather plant/sensor data?? Is that a real job..?? Maybe i should've pursued life sciences after all.. I'm an outdoorsy person, often taking motorcycle scenic routes, hikin' to waterfalls 'n hot springs, so i'll def be down for any adventure! :) Maybe there's some night (wilderness) EMT courses i can take?

life sciences definitely isn't my forte, but i've lived the permaculture life among small farmers/gardeners in Asia, so maybe we share some passions.. Or perhaps this'll give me a taste of bio-tech? Maybe some opportunities to write some simple data-science programs? Surely an opportunity to get familiar with various sensors.. Anything to get me outside, and i'll be happy!

just let me know via e-mail.

if you need references: my last supervisor at uc berkeley, and my last house-mates at berkeley: a phd candidate philosopher, another taking a break from a history of consciousness--surely deserved--, and one farm-loving undergrad dying within the STEM world there.. there's something about berkeley that makes it feel as if everyone's suffering.. ucsb seems like a much brighter world.. i'll know soon!

if not, i'll be around town working at a cafe or vending out my van soon anyway. :)
