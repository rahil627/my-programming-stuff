      - add videos
    - fix the noisebridge part / sub-title part


dream jobs / goal:
  - *ux designer for games*
    - sounds even more satisfying than even design studio work, as i could really spend time honing, perfecting ui/ux design/controls

temp $ jobs:
  - web product startup jobs using the following tech:
   - *phoenix/elixir*
     - gradual typing coming soon!
     - live-view-native in dev!
     -> making my own web apps
   - *rails*
     - if no elixir jobs
     - or if i really like the company
     - or if it's really small / as founding engineer
   - asp.net
     - meh, might prefer rails, though probably better for big code-bases




ycombinator startup funding
  - very easy to apply!
    - just send an idea, even if it's the "late deadline"i
      - DONE
        - damn
    - seems to prefer having a co-founder.. :/
      - maybe can ask Sam
        - yeah, he would be perfect!! and he lives in SF!









job sites for smaller companies
  - through friends
  - direct
  - linked-in
    - TODO: ugh, may have to actually make an account..
  - craigslist
    - only the true gangstas use this
  - indeed
    - meh, seems useless

  - game studios
    - workwithindies
      - TODO: keep an eye out for ui/ux design
    - gamejobs.co
      - lots of big companies.. :/

  - design studios/agencies
    - TODO: ??

  - startups
    - *ycombinator*
      - the OG
      - *hnhiring*
        - extracts from hacker news whoishiring
      - has a jobs page
        - TODO: try this now
      - has a new job matching app
        - TODO: finish profile
      - co-founder..? meh :/
    - *remoteok*
      - must be super competitive..
    - zensearch
      - this site is great, but the companies are sooooo lame!
      - great filters, prioritize by keywords
    - wellfound (angellist)
      - looks legit, it's just that.. the startups seems so boring.. :/
    - something-ly
      - TODO: try next


job titles:
  - game ui/ux designer

  - product designer
  - product manager?

remote jobs
  - companies
    - wikimedia (wikipedia)
      - todo: software engineer for the content transform team
      - movement communications specialist, product and tech
    - duolingo
    - gitlab
      - also made with ruby on rails!! and uses ruby scripts too!
      - support engineer (worldwide/remote)
      - todo: others?

schools
  - both universities nor schools for younger people mostly use outdated enterprise software, which doesn't look fun
    - departments that need a computer person can be fulfilling, as one can be in control of all the software for that department, choosing what one likes, integrating stuff (n8n), making one's own, and also *the social aspect of getting to know everyone*
      - actually, wanting to be a part of the department/organization shouold be the main reason to be there: *choose a department you want to be in* (i.e. UCSC game/film, NYU game/itp, parson's design 'n tech, etc.)
    - *canvas uses ruby*
    - moodle uses php, yikes
    - *main problem is that you have to live near the campus, pay those costs, be near transient people*
      - however, *it could feel like a youth hostel*, lol
    

  - 1. edjoin.org
    - less competitive than university jobs, possibly same pay in a lower cost-of-living area
  - schooljobs/govermentjobs.com
    - may have to apply through here
  - district job boards

  - universities
    - less competitive than FAANG jobs
      - still likely has many goodie asians applying..
    - can take some classes, do EMT, etc.
    - UC
      - jobs.universityofcalifornia.edu
    - calpoly (SLO)
      - jobs.calpoly.edu
    - usc at SD (main campus is in downtown LA, a terrible location)
      - only school of medicine

FAANG:
google's products are in a graveyard, terrible design, though pragmatic

  - luna
    - game streaming market-place, like google stadia?
  - mostly web cloud server stuff
facebook? ew!
  - vr
apple is closed off
*microsoft* is the clear winner
  - good recent coop (or co-opt?) of open-source and linux stuff
    - linux sub-shell
    - vs-code
    - .NET core
    - C#
      - but then limited to C#, which i'm not really interested either for games or web.. i prefer jai/C/dragonruby (language and engine) and ruby+rails/elxiir+phoenix
    - xbox
