  - hunttress

      - siiiickk







dream jobs / goal:
  - *ux designer for games*
    - sounds even more satisfying than even design studio work, as i could really spend time honing, perfecting ui/ux design/controls

temp $ jobs:
  - web product startup jobs using the following tech:
   - *phoenix/elixir*
     - built-in gradual typing coming soon!
     - live-view-native in dev!
     -> making my own web apps
   - *rails*
     - it seems there still aren't many phoenix/elixir jobs..
     - also, i just LOVE ruby!
   - asp.net
     - meh, i much prefer phoenix/elixir, and still even prefer rails/ruby for community reasons, especially for their smaller communities, though, this is probably better than ruby for big code-bases

  - very easy to apply!
    - just send an idea, even if it's the "late deadline"i
      - DONE
        - ..DAMN!

  - general sites
  - levels.fyi
    - TODO: try some more..
    - seems to aggregate from the same boring big company sources, nothing deep
    - but does provide a very good filter system, possibly easy to scrape..
  - linkedin
    - sounds like the most useful nowadays..
      - seems like the aggregators catch these... nothing special..??
    - clicking apply doesn't mean you apply through linked it, it usually just goes to the company's website's software
    - it found and re-activated my old account..?
      - TODO: finish profile..
        - no need to even fill out a profile, for most jobs, you must apply through their own website
    - craigslist
      - only the true gangstas use this
    - indeed
      - meh, though people do say it works..??

  - game studios

      - TODO: others jobs??

schools
  - both universities nor schools for younger people mostly use outdated enterprise software, which doesn't look fun
    - departments that need a computer person can be fulfilling, as one can be in control of all the software for that department, choosing what one likes, integrating stuff (n8n), making one's own, and also *the social aspect of getting to know everyone*
      - actually, wanting to be a part of the department/organization shouold be the main reason to be there: *choose a department you want to be in* (i.e. UCSC game/film, NYU game/itp, parson's design 'n tech, etc.)
    - *canvas uses ruby*
    - moodle uses php, yikes
    - *main problem is that you have to live near the campus, pay those costs, be near transient people*
      - however, *it could feel like a youth hostel*, lol

    - .NET core
      - asp.net
        - blazor (web assembly), razor pages (mvc), razor components, etc.

      - but then limited to C#, which i'm not really interested either for games or web.. i prefer jai/C/dragonruby (language and engine) and ruby+rails/elixir+phoenix
    - xbox
