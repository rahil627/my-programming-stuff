#+title: Data Serialization Languages

i likely have notes on this elsewhere..
  - TODO: grep it

*csv*
  - how data is stored
  - "cannot represent complex, hierarchical data structures"
    - just flat (no hierarchy), tabular data
  - still useful, as it's the simplest form

*yaml*
  - the readable json
  - "it uses indentation to define relationships and hierarchy"
  - "supports complex data structures like lists and dictionaries (key-value pairs)"
    - no need for lua then..

json
  - ew
  - "JSON uses curly braces {} for objects and square brackets [] for arrays, and requires double quotes for strings. It does not support comments."
