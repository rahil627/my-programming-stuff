  - Java seems like garbage. It can't access hardware directly. It compiles down to [Java] bytecode, then a [Java] virtual machine (JVM) is needed to communicate with the hardware. Also, I don't know if there's an option to not use the garbage collector. This lead to Java compilers innovating in the run-time compilation: just-in-time compilation. So, for anyone who's into performance and low-level, the whole idea is just non-sense. Ideally, it's best to interact with the hardware as directly as possible. But, the performance costs were surely worth it, especially for the time, for it being a sort of write-once cross-platform solution. Nowadays, CLI (.net/Mono) and transpiled languages seem to have replaced Java's VM solution. I have no idea how those three solutions compare. It seems like C#'s CLI is slow, Haxe is good because it compiles down to C/C++, and JVM, surprisingly, is Haxe's fastest target! So, who knows! Compiler optimizations are nuts.



does not support pointers
garbage collection

more portable - java compiles results bytecode (instead of executable code), java run-time is a interpreter

no preprocessors, has import instead

java is more object oriented, removes useless C++ objects (struct, enum), removes silly syntax (::)

Generally Java is more robust than C++ due to the following:

Object handles (references) are automatically initialized to null.
Handles are checked before accessing, and exceptions are thrown in the event of problems.
You cannot access an array out of bounds.
Memory leaks are prevented by automatic garbage collection.

Java does not include structures or unions because the class encompasses these other forms. It is redundant to include them.
Java does not support operator overloading.
Java does not include a preprocessor or support the preprocessor directives. 
Java does not perform any automatic type conversions that result in a loss of precision. 
All the code in a Java program is encapsulated within one or more classes. Therefore, Java does not have global variables or global functions.
Java does not support multiple inheritance.
Java does not support destructors, but rather, add the finalize() function.
Java does not have the delete operator.
The << and >> are not overloaded for I/O operations.
Java does not support templates.


ShapeListNode newNode = new ShapeListNode(); //C++ - ShapeListNode newNode;


class NumericValue: public Value { //C++ - class NumericValue extends Value {



The Vector class implements a dynamic array of objects

Like Louis said, the difference between i++ and ++i only shows up if you're combining that increment with another operation. In his example the other operation is an assignment.

Similarities between ArrayLists and Vectors

    * Both can grow up during run time.
    * Both implement List interface.
    * With both, it is easier to remove or add elements at the end or start, but if you try to add or remove elements somewhere at middle of collection, they suffer performance wise. (Use LinkedLists if your programme need to do that a lot, but LinkList requires more memory and computation)

Now the differences

    * The major difference, as the documentation says, is just that vectors are synchronized. Now what does that mean, this means that if more than one thread in your code is to use that data, you are in trouble with ArrayList as the data is asynchronous. Though there are ways by which you can make your ArrayLists synchronous, but by default they are not. The obvious downside with vectors is the additional computation to handle threads.
    * The other difference is that with vectors, you can specify the incremental value, which is the amount with which the data structure will grow during the runtime. But with ArrayLists you have no option but to accept default that is the list will grow up 50% of original size everytime it needs additional space. It is advisable in both the cases to choose the initial size carefully.

My recommendation will be to use Arrays as much as possible, as they are fast and simple; of course you can not do that in cases where data set is completely dynamic. In these cases, go for ArrayList if your code is 'threadsafe' else Vectors or synchronous ArrayLists are suitable.
