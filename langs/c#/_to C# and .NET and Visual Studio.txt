C#/.NET:
nullable variable.value to get non-null value
extension method - static f(this datatype) { ... }
"" == String.empty == (stringVar.length == 0)
datatype keywords are associated to classes - int == int32, short == int16, try to use the class
parameterized queries - avoids SQL injection
data context - contains data classes and stored procedures
