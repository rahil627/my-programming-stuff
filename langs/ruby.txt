# create a Gemfile in the working directory with the following lines:

# installs all gems using the Gemfile

# generate docs for gems only used in the project? (to .yardoc/)

# formatters
all of the formatters (rubocop, rubyfmt, prettier, etc.) are options in the main ruby vscode extension's settings

rubocop does more than formatting, it's a deep linter that'll fix 'n optimize your code

rubocop
  - the first main one
  - **comes pre-installed with ruby**
prettier
  - came after rubocop, based on javascript's prettier linter
standard
  - a standard immutable config (because people can't agree), using rubocop
rufo
  - like standard but with a different taste/opinion
rubyfmt
  - written in rust and very fast













solargraph:
another lsp that's more featureful, but takes more effort to work: must use the yard gem to generate docs (as opposed to the standard rdoc, which the main ruby lsp uses)

https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/ml3zs2/which_one_is_a_better_vs_code_language_server_for/
  -  "Solargraph has more features. It can inference types and preview docs. But it requires building yard docs for all your gems, which can take a lot of time and be a big hassle."
  - The vscode-solargraph extension is designed to work well alongside vscode-ruby. I frequently use both, typically with `"ruby.useLanguageServer": false` so code intelligence features like autocompletion come from Solargraph.

    If you use vscode-ruby primarily for the debugger, vscode-ruby-debug is also an option.

# add this to the Gemfile
gem 'solargraph', group: :development

# install yard cli
# TODO: conflicts with 'gem install yard'??
sudo pacman -S ruby-yard

# generate docs for all ruby gems
# yard gems









can use binding.pry in code to break it and inspect everything up to that point
pry replaces irb (comes bundled with ruby)? or use both?
`cat filename`.capitalize
or
`cat filename`.pry # "goes into" the returned string, then can execute string methods
capitalize!
provides a very interactive way to use ruby, learning it's common methods along the way
can completely replace shell for most stuff


SUPER COOL STUFF

https://github.com/pry/pry#command-shell-integration
`ls -l`.split("\n")
  - normally use back-ticks for command substitution

file_names=`ls -l`
  - store it in a temp repl var

.cat #{Dir['*'].sample} | wc -l
  - use . to begin running a shell command (instead of using pry)
  - use string interpolation like syntax "#{string}", without quotes, to interpolate ruby code

.echo #{puts object} | rg '2' # searches the object.to_s
 
.echo #{p 'ls`.upcase() + `ls`} | rg doc
  - can even combine command sub with shell-mode



gem install pry-doc

# irb
# ruby's default repl irb is awesome, containing autocomplete!

# ri
# ruby's console app to search documentation
# Class#method
rdoc # re-builds docs?

# ruby comes with a web-server!
ruby -run -e httpd

# find maintained libs here

  - , great for choosing the best lib for a specific purpose (category)

# debug
try the user castwide's (maintainer of solargraph) debug extension

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=KoichiSasada.vscode-rdbg
  - can try? vs pry?







# just do it & ref

https://github.com/planetjekyll/awesome-jekyll-plugins
https://github.com/benbalter/
  - wrote most of the plugins thate are included by default for Jekyll
  - ***extremely* clean design**, beautiful really... i love it!!! :D
    - but i'm not really sure if that's better than just writing it all in a single main function..., if it were actually used as a class, it'd make sense... but i guess this is the ruby "everything is an object" way..?
  - for example: https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-titles-from-headings/blob/main/lib/jekyll-titles-from-headings/generator.rb
  
then, after reading some plugins, you'll be able to read Jekyll itself! :o
https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/tree/master/lib


## ref
https://github.com/ruby/ruby
  - open-source :)
  - https://github.com/ruby/ruby/tree/master/lib

https://hyperpolyglot.org/scripting
  - great to see where it differs and excels over python

https://github.com/markets/awesome-ruby
  - **github** (?? no way!!), gitlab, discourse, mastodon, jekyll, tons of web frameworks 'n templating languages... whoa... i didn't even know...
  
https://github.com/trending?l=ruby

https://www.ruby-lang.org/
  - official site

https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/
  - official docs, also on github?
  
https://www.rubydoc.info
  - like a package manager, but for docs. includes the readme of each package

http://ruby-doc.com/docs/ProgrammingRuby/
  - a complete book, wordy, tons of examples, very comprehensive, looks great!
  - the page on "Object-Oriented Design Libraries" is great, as i've never heard about them
  - "built-in classes and methods"
  - "standard library"
  - "threads and processes"

https://en.m.wikibooks.org/wiki/Ruby_Programming
  - feels like an alt unofficial site




# tools
https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/
  - contains a list of IDEs, text editors, 'n plugins
  - for vim, vim-ruby and RSense are mentioned
    - RSense is also used for emacs
  - from a reddit post dated ~2020, RubyMine (JetBrains) vs VS Code, it seemed VS Code was taking over, along with simpler editors like atom, vim, etc., but it sounded like many people have problems, probably because of use of Ruby's complex features not working well with the language server...



useful libs:
https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/English.html
  - basically, you can alias anything in ruby, so, you can pretty much make your own language! :D
https://github.com/pry/pry
  - next-level shell hackery



# why?
i prefer the syntax, expressiveness, clean 'n tidyness, and fun of ruby over python :)

its also a funny way to write very clean simple scripts in a more functional style

anyway, anything is better than bash!
-


basically, i just want to use Ruby for shell scripting, because bash is hella ugly, and i don't think zsh really fixes that due to compatibility with bash (posix). Fish is an interesting alternative, but, anyway, i think Ruby can be a cool general-use "scripting" langauge--basically glue for all sorts of every-day problems :)

# learn
# 1. learn x in y minutes
todo: get link


# 2. jump in

see the source code of Jekyll plugins
then see the source code of Jekyll


# useful links

https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/
  - main site, includes links to many now ancient classic tutorials, but it's better to just read Jekyll code, or something similar to what you want to do
  - **good from other langauge page**
  - **good ruby in 20 min page**
  - **how to use gems**: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/libraries/
  - external links
    - tuts:
    - https://poignant.guide
      - comic-style, super adhd, but def special
    - https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/
      - for complete noobs, just goes over the language, but good site style
    - http://rubykoans.com
      - good interactive exercise, but the content is boring, as it doesn't use any "standard libs" or external libs, or any *real use*
    - https://try.ruby-lang.org
      - contains many examples to quickly go through
      
      
https://en.m.wikibooks.org/wiki/Ruby_Programming
  - in addition to being a wikibook, it contains a lot of useful links

https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.0/Kernel.html#method-i-spawn
https://ruby-doc.org/core-3.1.1/IO.html
  
kernal
- kernal contains most keywords, and base object methods?
  - exec, replaces current process to execute something
  - eval, interpreter
  - system, runs in a "subshell" (another process?)
    - i think this is the one you'd often use for batch files
  - spawn, "similar to system but it doesn't wait for the command to finish"
    - "The parent process should use Process.wait to collect the termination status of its child or use Process.detach to register disinterest in their status; otherwise, the operating system may accumulate zombie processes."
    - "has bunch of options to specify process attributes:"


# tutorials:

make sure you have a good set-up: vs code with ruby extensions, nvim with vim-ruby, or whatever, ad this it should be pretty easy to just get completion for everything for a "everything is an object" language

these three chapters look useful: otherwise, it's just the same ol' programming stuff... it's definitely much better to just jump into source code..
