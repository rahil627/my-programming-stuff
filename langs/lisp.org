* notes

** dynamic lang functions
*NOTE: this probably works with many languages with dynamic runtimes*
  - *including ruby!!*

spc-o-r
  - +eval/open-repl-other-window

run the entire program in repl
  - then can run any function, like pry

run (eval) regions of code
  - spc-k-e (spc-e in meow)
    - +eval/buffer-or-region

send regions of code, functions, etc. to a repl
  - then can run functions, macros, etc.
  - spc-k-s
    - +eval/send-region-to-repl
  - spc-c-??



** lisp lang notes

eventually, you'll probably naturally read enough lisp code when using emacs
  - spc-f-e
    - find file in ~/.emacs.d
      - TODO: .doommodule is the compiled file..? i can't seem to find the functions for dired..

(defun ra/post-config ())
  - can use / in the name? for name-spacing?
  - requires (), even if empty :/













* install lisp:
scoop install sbcl

* install a lispy editor:
emacs
  - yay!

lem
  - an editor written in common lisp!
  - has several front-ends: ncurses, sdl2, etc.
  - https://github.com/lem-project/lem
  - learn to use it!
    - https://lem-project.github.io/usage/usage/

x/portacle
  - an emacs config specialized for common lisp
    - meh, i already learned doom-meow-emacs..
  - https://portacle.github.io/
  - scoop install win-portacle
    - "couldn't find manifest"












* learning resources:

https://github.com/GustavBertram/awesome-common-lisp-learning
  - *lisp koans*
    - https://github.com/google/lisp-koans

*land of lisp*
  - an old book that *teaches lisp by making games (or pieces of games..)*, in that cute old way when people took the time to write books well

*let over lambda*
  - a book about macros!
  - https://letoverlambda.com/
    - first 6 chapters are online, maybe in the process of being uploaded..??

https://gigamonkeys.com/book/
  - practical common lisp, formmated for digital viewing
  - not bad for a reference book..

on lisp
  - bottom-up programming, including functional programming, rapid prototyping, interactive development, embedded languages, and CLOS

https://github.com/rabbibotton/clog/blob/main/LEARN.md
  - learn by using CLOG, a gui that uses the browser as it's engine??
  - sounds like good immediate feedback..
  - it has a lot of examples and tutorials, but i'd rather stick ot the std lib
