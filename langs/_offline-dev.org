merged from elsewhere:
setup heaps and imgui
try imgui with ruby!
  - https://github.com/vaiorabbit/ruby-imgui
  

devdocs.io
  - click on or enable the languages you need
    - NOTE: doesn't have docs for external libs
  - download them to use offline
    - devdocs.io/offline

ai
  - no offline ai :(
    - LLM would require too much compute power
    - though, it would provide privacy..! and not participate in giving data to the ai



* ruby

TODO:
  - add gems repo to emacs dirs
    - create a ruby workspace?

still seems best to just use ai to auto-generate some boiler-plate code, and work from there..
  - *TODO may have to try github co-pilot, or whatever that works with emacs..*, and create a good ai workflow with that..
  - *TODO: try generating phoenix and roda apps side-by-side*

ri
  - i think ruby comes with it..
  - maybe have to run it once..?
  - seems to grep docs straight from the code..
    - can search objects, functions, possibly vars
  - TODO: not sure how to browse objects though..
  - f/b to move down/up
  - q to quit

zenspider.com/ruby/quickref.html
  - nice!

github.com/khusnetdinov/rub.fundamental
  - patterns, principles, structures, threads



** install some gems:

gems come with docs, and sometimes even provide examples

dragonruby
  - incredible examples..
    - simple, no modules, classes, or anything fancy

rails
  - gem install rails
    - *just installing this will get you most of the web gems you'd ever need..*
  - see /guides/

roda
  - gem install roda
  - gitlab.com/fiachetti/mastering-roda
    - *NOTE: an incredible example of a single, giant .org file*

* haxe
