NOTE: *should aim to put everything you need into source repo*

devdocs.io
  - click on or enable the languages you need
    - NOTE: doesn't have docs for external libs
  - download them to use offline
    - devdocs.io/offline

download learn x in y minutes for each lang?

TODO: surely there's some cheat-sheet web-site..
  - zenspider.com/ruby/quickref.html
    - TODO: download this!
    - nice!

ai
  - no offline ai..
    - LLM would require too much compute power
    - though, it would provide privacy..! and not participate in giving data to the ai..



* haxe

just download the docs / web-site / manual / cookbook
download heaps web-site
std lib is really good, simple enough to immediately use!
 
* ruby


still seems best to just use ai to auto-generate some boiler-plate code, and work from there..

ri
  - ruby comes with it..
  - maybe have to run it once..?
  - seems to grep docs straight from the code..
    - can search objects, functions, possibly vars
  - TODO: not sure how to browse objects though..
  - f/b to move down/up
  - q to quit

pry
  - how does this differ from ri?
  
github.com/khusnetdinov/rub.fundamental
  - patterns, principles, structures, threads



** install some gems

gems come with docs, and sometimes even provide examples

dragonruby
  - *incredible samples*..
    - simple, no modules, classes, or anything fancy
    - *nothing beats learning via game-dev!*

rails
  - gem install rails
    - *just installing this will get you most of the web gems you'd ever need..*
  - see /guides/

roda
  - gem install roda
  - gitlab.com/fiachetti/mastering-roda
    - *NOTE: an incredible example of a single, giant .org file*
