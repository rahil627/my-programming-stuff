* scraper
  - jobs
    - NOTE: currently for personal use only
    - "junior ruby", "game community", "game support", "ruby support"
      - can use emacs to search/filter/grep regex data.. :D
        - emacs as the ultimate data (text) editor
  - *game data*
    - for game archive site
      - though it uses phoenix, can run as seperate ruby scripts..
  - *cooking recipes/site without the crap*
    - TODO: is this legal?
    - see [site-content-scraper.rb]
    - should work well from a phone
  - no web framework, just a simple ruby script using nokogiri
  -> leads to crawlers
    - *crawl the entire web for stuff??*
    -> may lead to ai agents
      - *ai agents that crawl the web??*
        - sounds like the matrix..!!


# from scraper script
# this is also an interesting program, as it can lead to more general social media / videos / web 2.0 / reality? to web 1.0 / text / database ideas..
#   - every sports game/match (publicly available)
#     - this is actually huge.. $$$
#       - start with ssbm and battle rap (the sports i watch)
#       - then e-sports
#       - then real sports
#       - and movies!
#   - every anything that is publicly available..
#   - every police video doing something wrong
#
#  - yeah... i just need to make shit... i can think of a billion ideas!


* map

  - roda
  -> can visualize with a js data viz lib,.. or a js game framework (haxe->js!!) :D
  -> leads to AR app

** mapping basics
  - start with a simple map using census data
    - could already get advanced, once it goes to other countries..!
    - could show migrations by using historical data (+time)
  - *map areas by livability: walkability/bikability/motorcyclability and zoning laws*
    - *technology to find the best urban area to live in*
    - zones for suburban strip-mall hell-holes vs places like ocean beach, SF, NYC
      - detected by analyzing google maps..?

** mapping responsibility/acccountability
  - then can try other data
    - judge/police/prosecutor names/locations/info
      - link to people convicted

** mapping hope
  - then create map apps that allow users to add/update various points of interest
    - squatting, public and private vending locations, farmer's markets, handicraft markets, camping (car, tent, hammock), public restrooms, public libraries, guerilla gardening/farming, etc.
    - vegetarian/vegan restaurants, locally-owned businesses
      - can try scraping from google, yelp, etc.
        - *could create a yelp for vegan/vegetarian only..* *along with other nature-loving businesses*
          - this is leading to *businesses with hope*
    - google maps public map feature?
      - maybe has api for this..



* technology to see history

** history image AR app
  - scrape photos related to your location
    - or chosen location
  - display them at same coordinate
  - can it be done via web..?
    - sure! just allow access to geolocation sensor

* technology to connect people
  - a new craigslist (classifieds posting)
    - a new job site
  - *a new room and room-mate finder*
    - very much needed..
  - a sharing site
    - tools, house, land, property: commodities

* technology to find great art/products/ideas/things

this is turning out to be a *documentation* project: document and organize the world

most of these are things that can be consumed: consumption consumerism, commodities (except art)

a simple product diplay website
  - could be whatever
    - TODO: what products can use a site make-over?
      - could be whatever i'm passionate about
      - NOTE: possible to make $$$ here.. very easily with a new car site..

** games
- see [game archive]
** motorcycles
- really does need a better database/wiki
  - scrape from all sources
  - scrape from motorcycle forums, discord, wikis, etc.
  - allow users to edit
    - link to existing wiki?
  - could also make it pretty like letterboxd
    - allow reviews, user photos, etc.
** weed
- could easily make the best weed website!
  - search based on effects, inherited strains, etc.
- scrape databases
- have fun making the front-end
  - *it's the ui/ux that sets it apart from the rest*
  - try figma
  - make it trippy using web-gl effects
  - can start with a roda PWA..? or phoenix-live-view?
    - some funky node-based diagram in space, with the images of buds, with lines connected those with relationships
  - should show tree, branch, flower/bud, and then scrape more nice photos of it, when the user asks for it
** tea
- now that's a bit more sober than weed..!! :)
** alcohol
- *big $$ here*
** programming languages
- single page, features matrix, editable
  - might as well use wikipedia instead for this..
** art
- documenting all art is kinda insane..
  - what is art?? lol
- ...but considering how poorly games are documented, surely all arts suffer form poor documentation.. and amazing unknown artists


* tech for language/cultural preserveration
indigenous languages
a digital visualization of all languages, and how they're connected
  - sounds/phenomes?, vocabulary, etc.
a map overlay of languages spoken (and ethnicity, and culture?, gender?)

indigenous music
  - an app to listen to different areas in the world
    - ambience, but also including indigenous dances, day-to-day talking, singing at night

building homes
cooking
foraging
farming
games
etc.

* tech for nature preservation
easily see a map of all real nature ("old growth"), fake nature (cut and re-planted)

* plants, herbs, food
tech that links plants to herbal and food recipes
  - pharmacology?

* responsiblity
** tech to calculate the people/govs responsible killing the planet the most
this'll be interesting to build an equation for.. ecological damage

also a good visualization

*** tech to calculate the people/govs reponsible for killing other people the most
deadliest people
