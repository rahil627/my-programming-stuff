naming conventions:
in general, spaces are fine and is the norm for windows at least since '95
for programming, however:
no spaces to avoid quoting in cli
  - also no spaces for uri reasons
no hyphen in the beginning as it gets conflated with cli options
underscores are good for putting at the top of the sorted list, in addition, it seperates the concept of wanting a file on top vs a subtitute for spaces--which is what i use hyphens for
  - however, it can make it harder to find in terminals, as you'd have to know the file has a _ in front of it and type _ first as opposed to the first letter of the file-name in order to trigger auto-complete, though, fuzzy search solves this. In general, it just makes paths a bit more funky. And every folder/file that starts with a _ will add a bit more funk into the path

limits:
cannot use: <>:"/\|?*
260 char limit for path
no trailing space or period
file-names are not case-sensitive, but the case is preserved


file structure:
$home = C:\Users\ra
  my custom folders:
  - \OneDrive\my-stuff-on-a-cloud
    - vs my-cloudy-stuff
      - i prefer my-stuff-... as auto-complete will reveal the rest
    - ALL FILES TO SYNC GO HERE
      - TODO: vs a temporary folder on dropbox
      - WARNING: all your data are belong to Microsoft!!
  - \my-stuff
    - ALL FILES TO NOT SYNC GO HERE
    - TODO: couldn't move a shortcut in \stuff
    - \repos
      - to avoid adding .git folder to the cloud


  windows default folders:
  - \Documents (local)
    - if using onedrive, this will be empty, but if you stop using onedrive, the documents folder on the cloud will be moved here
      - so, keep this empty for now
  - \OneDrive (cloud, 5tb free)
    - these three are added/synced by default:
    - Documents
      - programs throw their user-facing files here (and their non-user-facing data in AppData)
        - good to backup user-settings
    - Desktop
      - good to backup temp files
    - Pictures
      - always good to backup!
  - 'My Documents\Pictures\Videos\etc.' (shortcuts to ~\Documents\[My ...])
  - \Saved Games
  - ... a ton of hidden windows shortcuts
    - my documents, start menu, sendto, recent, etc.
  - ntuser.dat, ntuser.dat.log1, ntuser.datlog2




can't exclude folders to sync in microsoft onedrive:
https://www.reddit.com/r/onedrive/comments/e0oj41/how_can_i_get_onedrive_to_exclude_a_local_folder/https://www.reddit.com/r/onedrive/comments/e0oj41/how_can_i_get_onedrive_to_exclude_a_local_folder/
  - "I know you can exclude folders from sync - but this appears to exclude cloud folders from syncing locally, not vice versa"
  - "You can‘t exclude a subfolder of a folder that is syncing to the cloud."
  - might be done by design, so that you are compelled to buy more cloud storage.. :/


my stuff vs stuff vs _my-stuff vs -my-stuff
conclusion: i still prefer 'my-stuff' over 'stuff'
  - \my-stuff (conflicts name with the legacy 'My Documents' shortcut)
    - this was my original folder in linux/mac/dropbox
    - 'my-' is enough for terminal to guess it
  x/- \_my-stuff has _ and -
  x/- \-my-stuff will work well in terminals and folder priority over the other crap...
    - update: nope! doesn't work with windows, as it looks like a command-line flag
  - \stuff
    - simple, good, fits windows 11 naming conventions, works in terminals, just the folder priority in gui`s suck


file and folder naming conventions:
stick to 'names with spaces' and let terminal do it's magic
  - feels good to be back to spaces :)

this-might-suck for windows's built-in search functions


package managers:
winget
  - added to windows 10 sometime
  - installs to system, requires admin rights
chocolatey
  - community-organized
  - installs to system, requires admin rights
scoop
  - doesn't use msi installers which mess with the registry
  - thus oriented toward portable apps
  - installs to ~/scoop/, sounds similar to snap

note: there's also windows sandbox to install stuff in temporarily

conclusion:

scoop > winget > chocolatey

scoop for most apps, especially apps that you'd expect linux to have, as it's the cleanest, sandboxed, and often adds it to the terminal and start menu ("shims?")
winget for essentials to be integrated into windows, allowing windows to backup your settings
chocolatey as last resort
