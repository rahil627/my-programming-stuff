enable gpu support:
  - error: it prompts me to restart the linux container whenever i try to run an app from a shortcut (.desktop) via chromeos
    - hmmm, seems to have fixed itself..
open chrome://flags
search for 'crostini gpu support'
enable it
  - the value 'default' = 'disabled'
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
test it
  - sudo apt install mesa-utils vulkan-tools
  - glxinfo -B
  - vulkaninfo

or you could start it manually
vmc start --enable-gpu

as of 2025, it uses virgl drivers with virtio-gpu (for sommelier, the wayland compositor that chromeos uses)

change app shortcut command line options
  - Take a look under /usr/share/applications/ and/or ~/.local/share/applications/. That's where you'll find the *.desktop files which define how an app gets listed in the launcher. You should be able to edit the Exec= line there to change how the executable gets called

Create a Linux application shortcut:
  - (generated by ai)

  
Open the Linux terminal.
Create a .desktop file using a text editor like nano:
sudo nano /usr/share/applications/yourapp.desktop
Add the following content to the file, replacing the bracketed information with your app's details:
desktop


[Desktop Entry]
Name=Your App Name
Comment=A description of your app
Exec=/path/to/your/app
Icon=/path/to/your/icon.png
Terminal=false
Type=Application


Exec: The command to run your application.
Icon: The path to the icon file, which you may need to place in a directory like /usr/share/icons/.
Terminal: Set to true if the app needs to run in a terminal, false otherwise.
Save the file and exit the editor. Your new shortcut should now appear in the Linux apps folder in your Chrome OS launcher.
