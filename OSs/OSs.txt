TODO: can move game/renderer-related notes out.. but it is one of the biggest factors for me.. hmm..


linux:
  - UPDATE: with the advent of better display managers (KDE plasma) and new systems devs, especially rust and C, and the lack of innovation and efficieny by corporate OSs, linux actually looks and performs better than windows!
  - x/sucks for games
    - UPDATE: big improvement since proton and vulkan, with *proton running ~90% of games (see protondb) and almost only 10% difference in performance!!*
    - have to run directx games (and windows apps) via emulation
      - though, that's a problem of it being propietary, and devs targeting windows.. at least as their first platform
      - proton/wine
        - emulation that translates directx on-the-fly to vulkan
        - supported by valve/steam deck
  - good for automating / building reproducible configs
  - good to learn the ancient ways of cli/shells
    - not sure if this is a pro..
  - non-corporate / free and open-source software (foss)-oriented community
    - this has its pros 'n cons..
  - *great for devs, as there are no restrictions on what you use to make apps, lol*
    - *much much better to work with open-source, cross-platform tools (opengl, vulkan, qt) than propietary crap, contributing to the open-source world, as opposed to some corporation*


windows:
  - UPDATE: no big update since forever, and no hardware ownership like apple, so, there's little difference from this and linux, save supported games, graphics drivers, and direct3d performance
    - linux with contemporary display managers actually may be better..
  - *just works*
  - *games.*
    - gamer community
    - directx performs really well with windows, compared to vulkan on linux
  - *graphics.*
  - winget/scoop
    - the best portable app package manager
    - a singular (no distros), native, secured package manager
  - WSL
    - a powerful native VM for linux, running at near natively-installed performance
  - powershell.
    - a much needed improvement over bash
  - *doesn't care about how the apps look! You can download anything from the internet and run it*
  - phone link
  - with pro: native sandbox, bitlocker


mac:
  - UPDATE: *m-series made mac a big comeback*, with the m4 integrated cpu/gpu/arm thing rivaling $350 graphics cards..! yep, *they still have the best all-in-one laptop hardware*..
    - but, as it uses ARM, only can install asahilinux, which is still new/not ready, and *most past games just weren't made/compiled for arm*.. in addition to it still being the worst OS to make games and apps for..
  - no games / graphics
   - UPDATE: yep, still the worst
   - metal renderer considered quite a good, as it layered api: high-level like opengl and low-level like vulkan/dx12
   - have to run directx games (and windows apps) via emulation
     - apple made a 'game porting toolkit' (gptk), based on wine..??
       - crossover/whisky/steam
         - whisky is a gui wrapper around gptk
           - seems to be trying to copy valve's proton.. but just not there, since *apple folks just don't care about games..*
  - *propietary stack: hardware and software!*
	- propietary hardware
	- propietary accessories
      - including basic cables
    - propietary architecture?
	  - m-series, powerpc
  - makes it difficult for people to make games
    - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23048633
  - makes it difficult for people to make apps
    - TODO: read: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30790964
      - and it seems to have gotten worse..!!
    - though, everyone just makes web apps now anyway..
  - meets unix specs
    - derives from bsd unix kernal
      - so you still need macos binaries (elf vs mach-o)
    - macos might not have dependencies to run the app either.. the libs are different :/


iOS:
  - makes it difficult for developers to make apps
    - requires apps to be native-looking (and thus creates the cross-platform ui problem)
      - which.. i'm really not mad at anymore..
    - no at-run-time compilation (vm/interpreter)
      - though, embedded scripting langs seem to fine..
      - i'm also not mad at this either.. it just has to communicate with C, which is everything, and better than android..




history:

unix:
  - TODO: likely noted elsewhere..
  - from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix :
  - made at AT&T Bell Labs research center, along with the folks that made the C language
    - (and thus uses C, and is the first portable OS)
  - it ran back on "minicomputers" and "mainframes" in the 1970s!
  - promoted a *unix philosophy*
    - "the idea that the power of a system comes more from the relationships among programs than from the programs themselves"
    - the use of plain text for storing data
      - including treating devices and certain types of inter-process communication (IPC) as files
    - a hierarchical file system
    - and the use of a large number of software tools, small programs that can be strung together through a command-line interpreter using pipes (as opposed to using a single monolithic program that includes all of the same functionality):
      - Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
      - Write programs to work together.
      - Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.
        - inter-process communication via pipes
        - shell scripting and command language to combines tools and create workflows
