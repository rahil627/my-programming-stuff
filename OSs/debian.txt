  - i left a comment here..

it's a lot.. but generally:
updates sources lists
  - debian 12->13 changed the syntax and merged them all to one file
    - see below
  - NOTE: chromeos seems to work fine, and it's package is included in the main trixie repo
    - TODO: not sure if i need the cros-packages
  - see [[sources list]] file below
apt update
apt upgrade --without-new-pkgs
  - do this first for a minimal upgrade first
apt full-upgrade 
  - then the main upgrade
apt autoremove

extra cleaning:
apt list '?obsolete'
  - NOTE: this one shows chromeos cros- packages.. hmmm
          in addition to: github-desktop, mise, tldr, etc.
          and imagemagick..?? 
apt purge '?obsolete'
  - TODO: so i didn't run this one..



apt list '?config-files'
apt purge '?config-files'
