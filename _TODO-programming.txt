a general catch-all file for TODOs related to programming..

..for the few things i don't do in emacs..
  - (though it surely can do it..!)

NOTE: for the most part, should just keep the TODOs in the file, where the thought came from, and search/grep (dir) them via emacs
  - TODO: i haven't even got to this..!!

TODO: create a repo in home folder, ignoring everything except my emacs and focus configs
  - TEMP: for the moment i just created a copy-configs script in /configs/copy-configs (symlink)
  - see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21266948/use-git-to-manage-home-directory
  - x/or file-watchers to update my catch-all repo..
    - git makes more sense.. as you don't want a bunch of file-watchers running all the time..
