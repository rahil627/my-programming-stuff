a general catch-all file for TODOs related to programming..

..for the few things i don't do in emacs..
  - (though it surely can do it..!)

GOAL: for the most part, should just keep the TODOs in the file, where the thought came from, and search/grep (dir) them via emacs
  - TODO: i haven't even got to this..!!

migrate from github (m$) to gitlab (insitutional investors..?? hmm..)
  - some reasons:
    - TODO: move to [version-control]

      - OP, the right answer is Gitlab.

        Have always offered private repositories (Github didn't for a long time)
        
        Provide a hefty number of features for free which *really* help structurate a project if you're ready to invest some elbow grease (do not that many things related to advanced continuous integration and testing require a paid subscription AFAIR, but everything is explicit on their website anyways).
        
        DOESN'T GIVE ALL YOUR DATA FOR COPILOT TO USE.
        
        Continously improves Gitlab in every aspect (and those are not just cosmetic things, there are real new features actually useful, if only for a subset of high-level automation) AND regularly pushes back those innovations in free version (I don't understand in detail how they balance free vs paid for new features but I did witness that anyways).
        
        Github provides a bit more visibility because many more projects around and historically the first share git repository, but unless you're a new developer just trying some repository to drop basic (but well written!) projects to sell him/herself to employers, it's reaaaally not worth tying yourself up with Microsoft."
    - https://www.reddit.com/r/git/comments/1os4now/gitlab_vs_github/
      - open-source
      - better ci/cd
      - can self-host (without a paid edition..)
      - "Gitlab is simpler and more integrated. Github has better interface and features."
      - "Github is owned by Microsoft. This gives them access to Azure Infrastructure, integrations with VSCode etc. but also means their strategy is now all about AI and copilot."
    - welp, that's that..

TODO: create a repo in home folder, ignoring everything except my emacs and focus configs
  - TEMP: for the moment i just created a copy-configs script in /configs/copy-configs (symlink)
  - see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21266948/use-git-to-manage-home-directory
  - x/or file-watchers to update my catch-all repo..
    - git makes more sense.. as you don't want a bunch of file-watchers running all the time..
