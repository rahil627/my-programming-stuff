* cli commands

org seems to work well for shell, or anything that uses # for comments..
  - no need for org-babel here!

# install elixir
# see elixir.txt
# https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html
scoop install erlang
scoop install elixir

# if linux:
# install a file-system watcher in order to have live-reloading to work completely
pacman -S inotify-tools

# in case you need a db (can choose any)
scoop install postgresql
#sudo pacman -S postgresql

# Run run 'pg_ctl start' or 'pg_ctl stop' to start and stop the database or register it as a service by running 'pg_ctl register -N PostgreSQL' from an elevated shell.

# install elixir's package manager
mix local.hex

# install phoenix's new project generator
mix archive.install hex phx_new




# get a server up and runnin'
# https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/up_and_running.html

# check options before creating a new project. Although it seems like a lot is added by default (tailwind, esbuild, liveview, etc.), it's best to just use the defaults as it's a very "batteries-included" framework; try not to worry about starting minimalist/modular
# (great documentation via cli!)
# uses postgressql by default
# can try bandit http server over the default cowboy
#   - cowboy is written in erlang, bandit was written specifically for plug, in elixir, and therefore phoenix, ridding some unused bloat
# --no-live just comments out live-view-related stuff, so hopefully can uncomment it when it's needed
mix help phx.new
#  - even the generated authentication can make use of live-view, so just keep it on

mix phx.new my_project --adapter bandit

cd my_project

# if you didn't make the git repo already..
git init

# create database
# check/edit database config (db user/pass, host, port, etc.) if needed in dev.exs and run:
# before this though, make sure the database is running locally:
pg_ctl start
# can check with pg_isready
mix ecto.create

# start your Phoenix app with:
# ensure you are running the terminal as admin on windows
mix phx.server

# you can also run your app inside iex (interactive elixir):
# TODO: try this another time
iex -S mix phx.serverate

# check it out! yay!! :)
http://localhost:4000/






* set-up a database

# can use this mix script to generate basic schemas
# schemas are table-like data entities?
# fields = columns of a database table
mix phx.gen.schema Thing things field_name:type field_name2:type
# generates the schema file and a file that contains a script to create the table:
# creating lib/game_archive/thing.ex
# creating priv/repo/migrations/20240731053228_create_things.exs

# but i think you eventually have to edit the generated code to map relationships beyond simple foreign keys (field_name:reference:schema)

# then "migrate" the data? (create tables)
# ensure db is connected
mix ecto.migrate


# TODO: do some reading up on ecto
# https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Schema.html#content
# https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Schema.html#has_many/3-has_many-has_one-through
# some notes:
# By default, a schema will automatically generate a primary key which is named id and of type :integer
# array in ecto = list in elixir (maybe ecto is from erlang?)
# :map

# relations
# has_many(t)
# has_one(t)
# many_to_many(t)

https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Schema.html#timestamps/1
# timestamps() is a macro that generates inserted_at and updated_at fields
# this was added automatically when i ran it:
# timestamps(type: :utc_datetime)







* creating a context/controller/views/templates

def have to do some reading..
go through all of the guides in the manual:
https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/1.4.3/adding_pages.html#content

# mix phx.gen.html
https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Mix.Tasks.Phx.Gen.Html.html#module-customizing-the-context-schema-tables-and-migrations
  - "Generates controller with view, templates, schema and context for an HTML resource."

holy shit, this is nuts!

it generated pages for editing, updating, deleting data from a database!!!

with these generated scripts, there isn't much phoenix-related code you need to write!


https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/contexts.html
  - "Contexts are dedicated modules that expose and group related functionality. For example, anytime you call Elixir's standard library, be it Logger.info/1 or Stream.map/2, you are accessing different contexts...By giving modules that expose and group related functionality the name contexts, we help developers identify these patterns and talk about them. At the end of the day, contexts are just modules, as are your controllers, views, etc."
  - "In Phoenix, contexts often encapsulate data access and data validation. They often talk to a database or APIs. Overall, think of them as boundaries to decouple and isolate parts of your application."

  - NOTE: this page will lead you through finshing up phx.gen.html (which includes phx.gen.context and phx.gen.schema by default)


for whatever reason my context (games.ex) wasn't completely generated, i had to copy from the docs for contexts





read this for ecto/sql query dsl:
https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/3.10.1/Ecto.Repo.html#query-api
https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/3.10.1/Ecto.Repo.html#schema-api



* some common db commands (psql)
# TODO: move to postgressql.txt somewhere
pg_ctl start/stop/restart?/status

psql

# NOTE:
# ecto doesn't provide a simple way to do these things
# though you can try via iex..
# it's best to just use db cli tools such as psql

# can also use a database-indepedent program in the future
# this one is written in go, meant to be feature-compatible to psql
# https://github.com/xo/usql

# TODO: try some cli programs from archlinux package repo
# TODO: pgcli?

psql -d "game_archive_dev" -U "postgres"
psql -h "hostname goes here" -U "postgres"
# this enters a console/mode

[run sql commands directly]
select * from table_name; # remember the semi-colon!

\?
  - list commands
\l
  - list databases
\d
  - list tables, sequences, etc.
  - \d table_name
    - output table structure
  - \dt
    - list tables only

\o output_file.txt
  - start capturing the output to a file
  - \o again to stop capturing
\i input_file.txt
  - run a psql script



* generate some data
# https://medium.com/geekculture/phoenix-understanding-how-to-seed-data-c2be863ddd1d
#  - very good post teaching how to use seeds.exs, mix aliases, and faker lib





** some common mix tasks

# re-create db
pg_ctl start
mix ecto.drop
mix ecto.create
mix ecto.migrate


mix ecto.create
  - create the database which is used by your repository as backend
mix ecto.migrate
  - runs the pending migrations for your repository
mix ecto.drop
  - drops the database






* naming conventions
The convention is to have:
plural for context: Games.ex
singular for schema: Game.ex
plural for table name: games
singular for controller/view: GameController

UpperCamelCase

- https://elixirforum.com/t/context-module-name-and-ecto-schema-module-name-for-more-than-one-word-database-tables/44396/6?u=rahil627




* file structure
/
  - mix.exs
    - main project file
    - dependencies
    - lists aliases for mix tasks for the project
/lib
  - most files you edit go here
/priv
  - generated stuff, no need to touch
  /migrations
    - files with create table






* hmm

https://thephoenixtutorial.org/book/ch1_from_zero_to_deploy
  - looks like a simple, one-page-html tutorial..

The Hex packages used by your app are found in the mix. exs file

# installs dependencies
# (asked when creating a new project)
mix deps.get

SKIPPING TUTORIAL, just go with ai and make the app

# go through how it works
# https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/request_lifecycle.html

The router maps unique HTTP verb/path pairs to controller/action pairs which will handle them. Controllers in Phoenix are simply Elixir modules. Actions are functions that are defined within these controllers.

http request -> endpoint -> router -> controller -> view -> template
tempalte = root layout +-> other layouts +-> template content



# perhaps start with a minimalistic app base?
