conclusion:
my simple notes -> org-mode (emacs)

use my own custom markup for simple notes
  - can enjoy thinking about and creating my own markup language (since i def don't want to make a programming language..!)
  - can also enjoy making a simple parser for it (in whatever programming language i want!)
once the note should have a relationship to another note or otherwise do something more, export to org file, and adopt org/org-mode-style links
can use both emacs and logseq (and working copy!) on mobile devices
can continue to use emacs for all things text related, and have the power of emacs, and my own customizations, and build my own customizations for personal writing/expression within it



other related tools:
**working-copy**
  - TODO: worth trying!
  - primarily a git app for mobile devices, but seems to have support for editing 'n previewing many languages, including markup languages like org
    - seems like _the_ mobile git app
  - **an interesting alternative to using dropbox with dropbox app (git repo with working-copy)**
    - though, def more painful than dropbox.. but less likely to lose data..?
  - free!

**jekyll**
  - a static-site generator written in ruby and used by github pages
    - i use this for my personal sites (plural!), especially for my blog/philosophical writings
    - tons of plugins
      - also can just write beautiful ruby scripts to do whatever you want
    - allows you to create your own custom markup template, so you can keep your own personal writing format
  + front-matter
    - but also have the option to simply upload an html file (which every knowledge-base app should be able to generate!)
  + folder 'n file structure

**pandoc**
  - "universal" markup translator: can import/export to any markup language
  - basically supports all common markup languages

bear
  - more of a markdown editor turned note-taking app
  - great markup/preview, especially for mobile OSs




formats:
**plain text files**
  - **my own personal notes' format**
   - easy to sift through with cli
   - with the exception of bold 'n italics, has no markup
     - TODO: need to standardize 'n re-format' bold 'n italics across all files
   - **can easily migrate to any other markup format**, once things get more complex
   - TODO: write a simple formatter/exporter to org

**org**
  - primarily used in emacs via org-mode
  - not as ubitiqous as markdown, so not all apps would support it
    - also, **it's particularly difficult to parse**
  - ~2003

markdown
  - current standard
    - though, beyond the most simple features, there is no standard (and still isn't according to the main author)
    - commonmark became the standard markdown variant
      - most uses of markdown use a variant of this (discord, github, other chat apps, etc.)
  - **not too bad, but i prefer creating my own expression**
  - won the war against asciidoc and restructuredtext
  - ~2004


dead formats:
asciidoc
  - markdown with more features, a single standard version, slightly before markdown was ideated
    - seems better than markdown..??
  - ruby parser/exporter: asciidoctor
  - ~2002

restructuredtext (rst)
  - was used in the python world


apps:
**org-mode (emacs)**
  - **the granddaddy of all knowledge-management software**
  - people prefer the .org markup
  - **org-babel**
    - ...this is incredible..!?
  - **org-roam**
    - ?? more magic..?
  - file-export
    - latex, every imaginable format
  - deep emacs integration
  - no seperate mobile app, would just have to run emacs on it
    - **can use a terminal/linux-vm app (termux, termius, iSH) and install emacs**
    - **note: logseq treats org files equally as markdown**
      - ..or used to..

**obsidian**
  - current king of simple note-taking (though got nothing on org-mode)
  - **closed-source**
  - **great interface**
    - like a specialized vs-code, with an intuitive command pallete
    - feels well-made
    - unfortunately another electron app, so might as well use vs-code/dendron..?
  - plugins
  - **works really well on mobile devices**, nearly just as good as the desktop app
  - **emphasizes plain-text and markdown files**
  - diagram-making thing
  - graph view
  - views for outline by headings, tags, backlinks, etc.
  - bookmarks
    - seems useful!
    
**logseq**
  - seems to have it's uses despite obsidian's fame, and often used together with obsidian
  - more discoverability / nudge you into writing
  - **"emphasizes blocks and outlines**
  - **treats .org files same as markdown**
    - it seems one of the devs of logseq use emacs and org-mode, so..
    - UPDATE: maybe dropping support of org-mode..? :/
  - mobile app has some ways to go, especially compared to obsidian

x/joplin
  - poor man's open-source obsidian?
  - works on all platforms, and has a good linux cli
  - simple, takes a few seconds to get started
  - "notebooks" and tags
  - strange tracking metadata by default??
    - latitude: 37.91613260
    - longitude: -122.31076500
    - altitude: 0.0000
  - simple tags metadata:
    - tags:
    - test
    - test2

x/dendron
  - https://discord.gg/AE3NRw9
  + front-matter
  + **a specific file 'n file-name structure**:
    - parent.parent.file
      - **no folders! hierarchies are in the file-name**
      - destroys my dropbox file-folder structure, which i much prefer
      - **TODO: see if there's an option for folders**
  - a vscode plugin, no standalone app
    - although, this may just be the best app for programmers that use vs code..
    - can just edit using your favorite simple text editors, it's just that there's likely built-in functions made for vs-code via the vs-code extension
    - **ugh, but vs-code is eating up my computer!!**, i prefer the freedom of using my own editor... or at least one lighter than vs-code
  - seems well made by a small team, or just one person
  
x/notion
  - historically, a great push for note-taking apps
  - a very clean note-taking app with tons of markup ability
  - **need internet to access!?**
  - *slow* for a note-taking app

onenote, evernote, etc.
  - old propietary note file format?
