  - static html
    - plain old html, came first and still works great
  - server-side rendering (cgi, asp.net, ruby, etc.)
    - great, but expensive
  - "plugins" (flash, java applets, etc.)
    - iphone killed it by not allowing it, and enforcing everyone to use standard http
  - ajax -> fetch()
    - an example: autocomplete
      - a json is sent upon every keystroke
  - single page apps
    - lead to react, angular, etc. frameworks
  - web sockets
    - allows you to leave a connection open and continously transfer data
      - enabling games, chat apps, etc. reactivity/interaction
  - web assembly
    - **why javascript compiler? why not just send native code over the net, so your computer can run it natively/as machine code?hence web assembly is a native runtime that works in a browser**
      - this then allows devs to use whatever language they like (that has a web assembly compiler)
  - made it to 9 minutes, gettin' sleepy

  - Turns out REST APIs weren't the answer (and that's OK!)
    - i still don't know what REST really means..??
	  - an architectural style of using HTTP response headers?

aka slugify

  - the standard reference doc for how it *should* work
  - see sections 2.2 and 2.3 for reserved and unreserved characters
  
  
  
Characters that are allowed in a URI but do not have a reserved
   purpose are called unreserved.  These include uppercase and lowercase
   letters, decimal digits, hyphen, period, underscore, and tilde.

      unreserved  = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / "_" / "~"
      
      
  
  
 reserved    = gen-delims / sub-delims

      gen-delims  = ":" / "/" / "?" / "#" / "[" / "]" / "@"

      sub-delims  = "!" / "$" / "&" / "'" / "(" / ")"
                  / "*" / "+" / "," / ";" / "="
