  - back to the good times. now and forever

emacs
  - replaces all of that linux garbage with one app.
    welp.. what a fucking waste of time all of that was..!!

chromeos
  - a few adjustments to chromeos settings
  - (config = just install emacs)


OLD:
dotfiles
  - configs used during a time i was exploring linux (via an iOS shell and chromeos linux container)
  - NOTE: even the apps i used have been replaced:
    - emacs > nvim
    - emacs > wezterm > alacritty
    - emacs async-run-shell-command via default shell (bash/dash, powershell) or an emacs shell (eshell, vterm) > any non-posix-compliant shell
linux
  - setup script contains main apps to install
    - mostly ported to windows install script
