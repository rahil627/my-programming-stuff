lol.. linux is so fucked up.. thank gawd for emax



see https://github.com/clo4/dotfiles  

replace server distro with openSUSE tumbleweed

update personal distro arch -> openSUSE leap
  - can try nix's package manager first via 'determinate nix installer'

how to fzf hidden files? is there a way within fzf, or is it a command flag?
  - update c+f and c+a+f bindings to show hidden files

create a ~/bin folder and link (soft or hard?) it to my scripts 'n cli apps

port old vim configs to NVChad/lua

make a directories bookmark script (fish function)

bind alt+control+l to 'clear' command

modify fzf to use fd command?
  - search 'find' in fzf_key_bindings.fish
  - is it much faster than find command?

too much searching:
c+r - fish command search
c+s+f - alacritty buffer search
a+r - fzf command search
a+s+r - fzf.fish's fzf search with preview and options

**add hidden files to fzf searches**
  - a+f, a+s+f, c+a+f, c+a+s+f
  - c+f taken by file manager
learn to use lf to replace gui file manager
  - show hidden files by default
show hidden files by default for chromeos**
note task manager for shortcuts for chromeos
re-bind fish's default reverse command history search
  - c+r and/or a+s+r
figure out what's wrong with the long prompt path
  - only on alacritty?


try DOOMemacs
  - NOTE: FROM FUTURE ME: lol.. surprisingly, this replaced linux cli!
  - compare to nvim
  - find a sane nvim config like doomemacs
    - NVChad!

alacritty has a alacritty.fish script
copy the official alacritty.yml config file, which has all the defaults commented out?
  - save as alacritty-defaults.yml

bindings dotfile?
  - check what fzf_fish plug-in binds, then create own bindings
    - fzf_configure_bindings --help
  - control+lower-case-only, alt+anything
  - bind function keys for stuff too?
  - c+a+r = reverse search, c+a+f = search directory with preview, a+c cd "widget", c+t find file "widget"
  - should make it:
  - a+f = search file without preview
  - a+s+f = search file with preview
  - a+c, a+h, a+r = reverse search command history
  - a+d = directory explorer / navigator

test changing terminal colors via iOS app, otherwise delete base16 themes?

delete ctags stuff?
  - including plugins related to it: vaxe (for haxe)
