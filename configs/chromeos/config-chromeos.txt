      - Historically Google has waited until after Debian's first point update has been released to update Crostini, at which point users are given the opportunity via the UI to upgrade existing containers. Also, at this point, new containers are built using the new stable version (i.e. bookworm). For non-technical people this is the safest way to go - just wait the couple of months or so and you'll be prompted.

change font
  - from terrible Tinos to something else!
  - in chrome browser -> settings -> search for appearance
    - sudo apt install fonts-crosextra-carlito/stable
    - sudo apt install fonts-crosextra-caladea/stable
      - fonts similar to microsoft's calibri

change terminal appearance
  - terminal -> terminal settings (in the ui)
  - chrome-untrusted://terminal/html/nassh_preferences_editor.html
    - wow, all of the settings are hidden here..! google is terrible at design

increase dpi on vs code
  - https://www.reddit.com/r/Crostini/comments/cesxr0/vscode_ui_and_fonts_too_small_heres_how_to_fix_it/
  - essentially, you modify: /usr/share/applications/code.desktop
  - #replace this line: Exec=/usr/share/code/code --unity-launch %F
  - Exec=sommelier -X --scale=0.8 --dpi=160 /usr/share/code/code "--unity-launch %F"
  - #replace this line: Exec=/usr/share/code/code --new-window %F
  - Exec=sommelier -X --scale=0.8 --dpi=160 /usr/share/code/code "--new-window %F"
  - Smaller value for --scale means more magnification. The fonts actually look sharp.

# limit systemd journal log file size
sed -i "s/SystemMaxUse=.*/SystemMaxUse=50M/" /etc/systemd/journald.conf

#   - check it
