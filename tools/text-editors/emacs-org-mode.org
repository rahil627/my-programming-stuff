#+title: Org




* bindings

interesting auto-indent..

i like * over # for headings.. though it could've been any symbol for easy parsing..

*** important
tab
  - fold/unfold headings
    - my favorite feature.. missing from helix??

shift-tab
  - toggle: overview, with sub-headings, all content
  - *great for navigation / quickly grasping*
    - though, a little overview panel would be better..

org-goto
  - spc-c-j
  - *great way to navigate, interactively*.. code files def need this mode!!


*** others
org-insert-link
  - file links actually open the file or directory (via dired)!!
    -  this is quite incredible... just have to make sure the files are under the same repo..

  - NOTE: org-mode overrides these to provide more bindings, based on where your cursor is:
    - (org-support-shift-select) to use original bindings

    - cycle another set of tags..? ([#A], [#B]..)
