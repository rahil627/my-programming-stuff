#+title: Org


* how it works

c-h spc m
  - TODO: really need to bind this..
  - describe-mode

headings as main structure unit
  - ways to navigate them: org-shifttab, org-goto, TODO: probably more..

headings can be tagged
  - *TODO: this is a little strange to me.. i think i prefer line-based tags..*
  - *TODO: remove most tags and add personal tags here: NOTE, etc.*
  - headings are categorized by: inactive and active

* bindings

interesting auto-indent..

i like * over # for headings.. though it could've been any symbol for easy parsing..
  - * is placed in an odd spot on the keyboard though..
    - probably expected to use c/m-return anyway.. along with m-left/right
  - # is used for comments in many prog langs anyway, pre-dated markdown by far..

*** important
tab
  - fold/unfold headings, sub-headings, sub-sub-headings..
    - my favorite feature.. missing from helix??

shift-tab
  - toggle: overview, with sub-headings, all content
  - *great for navigation / quickly grasping*
    - though, a little overview panel would be better..
  - org-shifttab

org-goto
  - spc-c-j
  - *great way to navigate, interactively*.. code files def need this mode!!


*** others

*c-l*
  - another pop-up menu..

org-insert-link
  - spc-l-l-l
  - *file links actually open the file or directory (via dired)!!*
    -  this is quite incredible... just have to make sure the files are under the same repo..

s-[arrow-keys]
  - NOTE: org-mode overrides these to provide more bindings, based on where your cursor is:
    - (org-support-shift-select) to use original bindings
  - on heading
    - cycle tag (TODO, [X]..)
    - cycle another set of tags..? ([#A], [#B]..)

c-[arrow-keys]

  - same as c-ret?
