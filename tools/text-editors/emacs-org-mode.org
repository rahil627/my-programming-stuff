#+title: Org




* bindings

interesting auto-indent..

i like * over # for headings.. though it could've been any symbol for easy parsing..
  - * is placed in an odd spot on the keyboard though..
  - # is used for comments in many prog langs anyway, pre-dated markdown by far..

*** important
tab
  - fold/unfold headings, sub-headings, sub-sub-headings..
    - my favorite feature.. missing from helix??

shift-tab
  - toggle: overview, with sub-headings, all content
  - *great for navigation / quickly grasping*
    - though, a little overview panel would be better..

org-goto
  - spc-c-j
  - *great way to navigate, interactively*.. code files def need this mode!!


*** others

*c-l*
  - another pop-up menu..

org-insert-link
  - spc-l-l-l
  - *file links actually open the file or directory (via dired)!!*
    -  this is quite incredible... just have to make sure the files are under the same repo..
