* config

*NOTE: don't you ever use it as admin/sudo!*

see [config.el] for notes on config
  - self-document!

*NOTE: first set up the right font and font size, it makes a big big difference!!*
  - can see a lot more in the mini-buffer!!
  - set font in terminal app settings or in doom's config.el


* workspace basics
it's nice to have dired open, when working within a project, to have a sort of visual view to come back to
  - TODO: maybe there's some kind of file explorer plug-in that can pop-up via a F-key
    - TODO: try treemacs

it's similarly nice to have an i-buffer window open, to visually see which buffers are open
  - TODO: maybe also part of treemacs?

if working quickly, just do quicksave/quickload (on doom's splash screen)
  - quitting doom emacs does this by default

TODO: projects vs workspaces vs persp(ective)


** language specific dev
*** ruby
the localleader map (c-c l) is really neat 'n simple

it has the following functions:

robe-start
  - if there's no project, may ask you to run inf-ruby, an inferior ruby process. from then on, i think it's the normal dynamic lang run-time dev experience, similar to elisp: send code into the run-time/process, introspect it, etc.
    - may run into problems loading libs/gems in correctly.. as there is no project / (gem) bundler setup..
  - the process will provide a repl console: irb
    - irb itself is it's own thing.. providing a cli to do a lot of things..
      - if you don't bundle the project, and just want to try running some script, use irb to load libs..??

robe-doc
  - introspects the running process for docs, so you are reading the docs in the code, not from some seperate external source
    - maybe that's why they say emacs is "self-documenting"..
  - how does it differ from irb's show_doc?
    - it makes use of emacs search engine mini-buffer, making it a far better experience than irb

c-c l s
  - send code key-map
  - can send a require gem statement

c-c k
  - i don't think robe module uses the lsp..
  
(irb)
  - introspect objects (run methods), debug, load files/libs, etc.
  - introspection explorer portion mimics cli commands: ls, cd

(completion)
  - pressing tab works, but functions aren't ordered.. :/
    - may have to try zed after all..
    - or maybe a lsp module for ruby??

* bindings
** a few quick ways to learn, interactively via run-time introspection:

learn x in y minutes / emacs


*find-function (c-h f)*
  - NOTE: contains all functions, and thus differs from m-x
    - 30k vs 7k functions
      
*find-var (c-h v)*


f12
  - gui menu
    - sometimes shows bindings for the menu item/command
    - TODO: how is this created..?

c-c
  - for major modes

*c-h b* / spc h b
  - b
    - all bindings
  - m
    - a better view of key-bindings quicker to undertand key-bindings than h-m..!
  - i
    - minor modes

c-h m
  - describe-mode
    - TODO: can't find this in the meow bindings..?
    - replaced by main info-emacs-manual
      - TODO: i might prefer it bound to h instead..

spc-h-M
  - doom/describe-active-minor-mode

[movement-command],[number]
  - repeat movement

emacs/meow philosophy
  - TODO: though, could add F for reverse find
    - no built-in function..? maybe emacs prefers moving forward only..?
  - helix used shift as a reverse modifier, i don't think emacs uses that idea..

** TODO some useful functions (to bind?)

find-function
find-var
  - maybe dependent on language.. dynamic languages only
  - hence they're under spc-l-g (for elisp)

** TODO some useful bindings

spc-spc (c-spc)
  - set-mark-command
    - TODO: this must be important..??

m-x / spc-m-x (meow/god), : (evil)
  - contains every function available (~7500 with default doom install, ~6750 with meow instead of evil key-bindings)
  - usually [module]-[function]

[[cmd:recenter-top-bottom][c-l]]
  - center, top, bottom
    - *super useful*, never used this feature in another editor..

m-s-right/left
  - move list indents
  - hmmm, didn't know m-s was ever used..!

c-s/c-r
  - isearch forward/reverse
    - TODO: redundant, could use shift instead

c-h f/v
describe-function
describe-var


some notes:
 - NOTE: it's still vi, so still need to re-map caps lock to escape
 - NOTE: f1-key is tough on a chromebook keyboard, but quite useful!


*** meow bindings

TODO: finish [[fn:meow-tutor][meow-tutor]]

** key bindings (actual keyboard keys)

TODO: PENDING: merge from my [helix] and [wezterm bindings]
  - see [config.el]

notably emacs shares movement commands with bash

describe-key

spc-/
  - meow-keypad-describe-key

spc-h-b
  - see all bindings interactively

*** some design notes on modifier keys, big keys, and other un-used keys from my [helix config]


# notes from helix config to merge..
# some possible keys:
# **esc**
#  - should be free TODO: don't use OS to bind it
#  - could save for a list of shell commands/scripts
# `/~
# **arrow keys for four more modes!!**


small un-bound keys:

back-quote (`)
  - ~ was used by games to toggle the dev console
  - used for lowercase/uppercase in helix
    - these key-chords were really annoying in emacs.. to the point of disabling them by default..!!
slash (/)
  - / was used by vim to signify search
    - maybe because file-paths have a lot of them..
back-slash (\)
  - can be big on certain keyboards..
  - in helix, runs a shell command (:sh ...)
    - TODO: see quickrun
    - though, less needed, as you'd likely just write (or generate with ai!) the functions with elisp..
  - i think | was used by helix for piping a program on a selection..??
    - it was a really interesting advanced function..
    - c-c a |
      - shell-command-on-region


other big keys:

caps-lock/search (on chrome os) is re-mapped to escape at os level

tab
  - NOTE: c/m-tab are often used by programs and window managers, possibly all major oses
  - cycle menus, words, completions, and certain major-mode stuff (org-cycle)
  - org uses it heavily
    - including s-tab
  - spc-x(/-spc) tab is really good too

backspace might be open to being re-mapped
  - maps to <DEL> by default
  - thanks to D (backward-delete), may not need
    - d, c-d, m-d all feel better than pressing backspace..
  - c-<DEL> and m-<DEL>
  - though, it's also nice to have a big ol' delete key too..
    - at least while transitioning..

return
  - TODO: overlaps with c-j??
  - org-mode makes a ton of use out of this one..
    - new line, new list item, new header, etc. (org-return)
  - i re-mapped this in helix for normal-mode only
    - this turned out to be quite a satisfying key to press when i did this in helix..
      - i used it as my own personal menu
        - it contained much of c-c q
          - (quit, save, restart, open/reload config, etc.)
        - sometimes i'd put bindings in it temporarily, until i figure out a place for them, or more likely, figure out i don't need them: i just have to learn more about the editor's functionalities






modifiers:

control and alt keys mappings are swapped on windows and chrome os at os level

(c)ontrol is the main modifier key to use

(m)eta/alt provides an alternative modifier key to use
  - NOTE: in helix and other terminal text editors, alt (no alt+shift) is reserved for terminal/tmux commands
    - thus no need for a weird modifier key combo.. these two are enough
  - these tend to be mapped to (alt)ernative functions
    - i haven't even explored these yet..

(c)ontrol + (m)eta
  - i haven't even explored these yet..
    - seems to be more code-oriented movement.. especially on C-M-? (don't know further down a key-sequence..)

(c)ontrol + (s)hift
  - was often used to denote the opposite action as control+key
    - this notion was by me, not emacs
      - this seems to have been replaced by meow-reverse (;)
        - ..genius!!
  - NOTE: this is usually un-bound in both terminal editors and emacs because terminals often prioritize the control modifier, making this input really unreliable
    - newer terminal emulators such as alacritty and kitty may have worked around this problem..
  - TODO: in emacs C-S-[key] maps to C-[key] as a fallback
    - maybe a meow thing..
  - this is generally open to re-map, but mostly limited to GUI-mode..

right-control and right-alt are rarely ever used because i tend to use the modifier keys on the left-side
  - TODO: really should fix this bad habit.. actually.. i have a lot of bad keyboard habits..

super (windows/mac key) is left untouched
  - linux kernal (and KDE Plasma) calls this meta, and alt remains alt
  - though it's possible over-ride it, providing yet another great key
    - better to over-ride the tab key instead
  - NOTE: doesn't exist on chromebook's keyboards

hyper is an extra option, though there isn't dedicated key for it..
  - this sounds like the perfect replacement for tab/caps-lock/backspace

shift also symbolizes extending selection
  - S-[hjkl] all work as expected
  - S-[arrow-keys] work too

arrow-keys work as expected in emacs (thankfully!!):
  - moves one char
  - S- highlights
    - works in combination with other modifiers:
  - C-right/left moves by words
  - C-down/up moves by paragraphs
    - this one feels great!
  - M-right/left  drag-stuff-right/left
    - NOTE: i changed this to end/begin of line
      - though, this one is actually really cool..!!
      - maybe should update down/up to use drag-stuff-down/up!!
        - TODO: C-M-down/up/left/right?? vs M- ..?
    - though, because of the pop use of x/m + i/a, it's rarely needed
    - c-x t transposes-lines
  - M-down/up page down/up

function keys
TODO: i haven't even tried the function keys yet..!
  - could use for toggling plugins (tree panel, terminal, build/run/de-bug, etc.).. but would i use it that often..?
  - could use for display management (buffer/window/tab) too
    - f1/f2 seems to be bound to previous/next buffer..
      - TODO: change system keys to require using a modifier key?

*** some ways to check bindings

spc-?
  - meow-cheat-sheet

spc-h-b-t

see [bindings-qwerty.el]

*** normal-mode keys (no modifiers)

NOTE: these bindings are amazing! i wouldn't change a thing!!

see [meow docs TUTORIAL.org states keypad]

compared to helix, notably lacks:
  - v for visual-mode
    - x to start it..?
  - g for goto-mode
    - *c-m- is certainly strange.. i might eventually just un-bind that entirely..*
  - m for match-mode
    - *replaces four keys?: [],.*
  - z for view-mode
    - though this is an existing emacs minor mode..
    - possibly broken by meow bindings..??
  - w window-mode
    - ??

**** un-bound
  - `
  - /
  - \

**** movement
  - hjkl
    - HJKL for shift selection

  - NOTE: the default emacs movement shortcuts are retained:
  - TODO: redundant, change it? or leave it, as that's the default emacs way..?
    - c-f/c-b and c-n/c-p == hjkl
    - m-f/m-b == w/b (and m-n/m-p aren't bound)
    - *c-a/c-e* =/= x,i/x,a
      - this one is acually useful
        - c-a is interactive, jumping between first non-whitespace to beginning of line

**** special
  - ;
    - reverse cursor position on selection from kakoune
    - not only reverse cursor position, but reverses the direction of interactive selection!!
  - -
    - negative-argument allows you to do things in an opposite way too
      - (- f a) will select up to a in the reverse direction
        - though (f a ;) seems better seems more intuitive to me in this case.. can toggle the direction with ;

  - '
    - repeat
    - this is a blessing!! (it wasn't working in helix..)
    - f/t, '
      - find/till char, repeat
    - ]d, '
      - end of function, repeat

  - <escape>
    - ignore
      - meow-escape

**** insert
  - i/a & I/A
    - no need for o/O (open below/above) in vi

**** selection
  - most of these activate selection
  - most of these expand current selection
    - arrow keys (with modifiers)
    - e/b, E/B
    - ]/[
    - ,/.
  - numbers (123456789) expand selection by repeating a function n times

  - g (; in evil)
    - cancel selection
    - TODO: repeat of escape..?
      - meow-cancel-selection vs meow-escape
      - as long as caps lock is escape, both are ergonomic to me..
  - z
    - undo selection
    - TODO: Z should be redo..? hmm..


  - x
    - x i/a
    - x s
    - x ; x
  - m
    - merge
    - seems to select the space between the beginning of line and the end of the last line
      - press m again to select the space between two lines, regardless of where you cursor is
    - m s
      - merges the two lines
    - also places the cursor at the first-non-whitespace in the line, unlike x
      - m a
        - first non-whitespace
      - x i
        - beginning of line
      - m i ~= x a
        - end of line


  - w/e/b & W/E/B are much improved!

  - [ begin [thing]
  - ] end [thing]
  - , inner [thing]
  - . outer [thing]
    - replaces m (match) key-map of helix, which felt confusing 'n convoluted anyway.. having to press mim or mi. using letters is much better
    - use these for select to end/beginning of line(??): [,l and ],l; removes the need for creating key-bindings for this in helix. though quite important keys, it makes sense to put them here

**** seek (and select)
these will break the current selection (and create a new one), instead of expanding it

  - v visit
    - it's search filter is very picky: case-sensitive, symbols attaches to the beginning or end..
      - though maybe difficult to remember symbols, it makes it really good to narrow down choices
    - replaces / in vi
    - searches and selects
      - spc-s-s/S only searches
    - (then press n / ; n)
      - saves to regex-kill-ring
    - TODO: docs mention a way of setting regex for it..
    - TODO: haven't figured out how visit differs from isearch-   forward/backward (c-s, c-r)
      - actually, these seem like wayyy more complicated interactive functions.. full of even more emacs-styke key-bindings

  - o
    - meow-block
      - seeks out the next pair of closing-symbols, and goes to the end of it
        - great to seek function parameters
        - also great to seek the end of functions
          - perfect for editing comments
        - must be incredible for lisp..!!
        - inner/outer/begin/end thing doesn't seek: they assume you are in the thing

      - TODO: pressing it again doesn't hop to the next block
  - O
    - meow-to-block
      - can press again

  - f/t
    - find/till

**** delete shit
  - d/D
    - reverse delete!! (alt to backspace)
      - *TODO: try practicing this..?*
      - *TODO: this frees backspace!!*
  - s
    - pro-tip: pressing s when nothing is selected kills to end of line!!: genius!
      - no need for c-k
  - c
    - change
      - delete and insert
        - only saves one key press

**** search 'n replace
  - n
    - search last selection
      - expected to use ; for reverse search
  - r
    - replace
      - works as expected! (unlike helix..)
  - (see R, G, Y)

  - un-bound:
    - q, T, F, V, <, >, /, {, }, :, ", _, =, \, |
      - avoids mapping to non-nmeumonic(?) symbols

**** yank (copy) 'n paste, or replace, undo
  - TODO: i don't understand why this notion is reversed in meow..
    - meow-save 'n meow-yank
  - p
    - paste
  - (see P under advanced)
  - y
    - yank
  - r
    - replace
  - u
   - undo
     - kinda just tacked this one on here..

  - G
    - grab *secondary selection*
      - hooooooly shiiiit
  - R
    - *swap with grabbed/secondary selection*
  - Y
    - copy primary selection and paste over secondary selection
      - great in case you are in the area you want to paste in first, a sort of reverse copy/paste

**** *advanced meow functions:*

  - U
    - *undo in selection*
    - TODO: maybe bind to vundo instead
  - P
    - *yank from kill ring* (meow-yank-pop)
      - stores killed and yanked text
      - seems to store system-clipboard yanked texts too!!
      - it's also interactive, so you can preview it in the buffer..!!

  - X and Q
    - meow-goto-line
    - TODO: can unbind these..


  - G
    - *secondary selection*
      - hooooooly shiiiit
    - meow-grab
  - R
    - *swap with selection*
    - meow-swap-grab
  - Y
    - copy primary selection and paste over secondary selection
      - great in case you are in the area you want to paste in first, a sort of reverse copy/paste
    - meow-sync-grab


  - *TODO: how to do multiple cursors??*
    - meow uses god-mode which binds spc-m to meta menu
    - spc c spc m
      - found in doom bindings..
*** insert-mode keys

x and w
  - triggers meow-visual-line / visual-line-mode
    - then can press arrow keys, or [] (begin/end of thing)

basic navigation is redundant:
  - TODO: change it? or leave it, as that's the default emacs way..?
  - c-f/c-b and c-n/c-p == hjkl
  - m-f/m-b == w/b
  - c-a/c-e == x,i/x,a

after selecting something (with anything: x, w, W, [p, ].), can press any number to select that number of things

everything else relies on emacs original bindings which are on:
see [c-key] and m-[key]
and other big keys

*** [f-keys]

NOTE: with a chromebook, i re-bind the search key (below tab) to escape, which blocks the default search+function key binding
  - must use escape + [f-key]

on my chromebook
  - f1/f2 have left/right arrows etched on them, some kind of special back/forward key
    - <XF86backward>, <XF86forward>
    - these are auto-magically binded to next/prev buffer!!
      - can be used to bind to next/prev window, workspace/tab, etc.


i think doom uses these to toggle various modules, such as treemacs (file/code explorer pane), minimap?, etc.
  - see [doom bindings file]
  
  
can keep these empty for project specific bindings, like calling scripts, ci/cd, etc. project actions

  
quite minimal..

**** only these two are useful:
f1
  - help
f12
  - *gui menu*
    - also can get here by clicking on various items on the status-line
      - major mode menu, minor mode menu
      - version control menu
      - line and column menu

**** the rest can be unbound:
f2
  - 2C 2 column functions
  - c-x 6
    - TODO: i dunno about this one.. loll
      - maybe ask the emacs folks..
f3
  - define keyboard macro
    - makes sense to be away from the normal keys..
  - NOTE: possibly redundant, can remove
    - c-x (
    - c-x )
      - strange place..
f4
  - execute keyboard macro
    - c-x k k
      - again in normal mode
    - a little too deep..

*** s-[key]

see meow-cheatsheet

see [normal-mode keys]
  - many are used by meow-mode's normal-mode

s-hjkl (HJKL)

s-[arrow-keys]

*** c-[key] and m-[key]

TODO: i haven't even got to these yet..!

these contain the original emacs bindings

these are generally consistent across modes (normal and insert) in meow

**** some basics:

key-chord trigger keys:
c-x
c-c
c-h

c-npfb
  - emacs basic movement keys

c-a
  - beginning-of-line
    - this combined with f simplifies cusor placement
c-e
  - end-of-line
- these two are immensely useful..
    
c-hjkl:
  - these suck
(c-h)
  - (help-map)
c-k
  - kill-line
c-j
  - return-and-maybe-indent
  - same as ret
    - TODO: seems redundant.. can try using it instead of return tho..
c-l
  - toggle center/peek bottom/top depending on cursor position
    - a very interesting key..


c-ret
  - +default/new-line-below
    - does exactly what you want!
  - org has it's own function

c-[arrow-keys]
  - *basic nav*
    - *very useful*, usually beats ][ (end/beginning of shortcuts)

m-down/up
  - page down/up

m-right/left
  - was strangely transpose
    - *swapped with previous/next symbol*

c-/
  - undo-fu-only-undo
  - use u for meow-undo instead
c-s-/ or c-?
  - undo-redo
  - moved to U

**** others

[empty]








*** mini-buffer
*PRO-TIP: c-s to show search history*
*PRO-TIP: m-s to use regex search*

press the initial key-chord, then, in the popup mini-buffer, press c-h to fuzzy search it
  - TODO: 
    
** modules
*** magit
github desktop, or likely any other gui, seems to be much simpler to grasp and use.. However, upon my first comparison, *it seems magit show far more details in the diff changes, whereas github desktop glances over it*, just highlighting the whole line red or green. So, it may be worth playing with some more..

spc-v
  - version control
  - enable magit and vc-gutter modules to show git functions

spc-v-g
  - status
  - start here

P push
  - p push (default)
    - main/origin?
  - u upstream?
    - main/origin?
*** dired
mark files 'n folders, then take action
  - and remember, can use favorite emacs commands to search text in the buffer!

m(ark)
u(undo)

capital keys for actions, for safety reasons
  - R, D
    - R is mv, use it for rename, move, cut/paste

*** flycheck (syntax checker)
just use the gui, mode-line, click on the little error/warning/info icons on the botttom right

c-c ! to trigger the menu

*** vundo

TODO: mark, diff??

** god-mode/meow

adds an alternate spc key-chord for modifier key combos
  - NOTE: some of these are hidden from the meow menu..
see [meow docs TUTORIAL.org under keypad]


TODO: get my answer from https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1oacbht/halp_im_drowning_by_keybindings_doommeow_includes/

adds space as an alternate key to trigger key-chords, as opposed to modifier key combos

*NOTE: all of these are hidden from the meow spc menu..*, hence it being quite small.. i guess it assumes you remember these..??



from meow's readme.org
 - when a key other than =x= / =h= / =c= / =m= / =g= is pressed in Keypad state, it is directly looked up in the leader keymap. This module sets =doom-leader-map= (bound to =C-c= by default) as the leader keymap. So, for example, =SPC s p= produces =C-c s p=.

see [[file:/home/ra/.doom.d/modules/editor/meow/config.el][meow config]]

      - TODO: hmmmm, must be important..

  - spc-x-[key] (c-x, c-[key])
    - NOTE: the second letter is automatically adds c- modifier
      - TODO: how to use use a normal letter..??

  - spc-c-[key] (c-c, c-[key])

  - spc-m-[key] (m-[key])
    - a good way to see otherwise hidden bindings

  - spc-g (c-m-[key])
    - go
      - more navigation stuff..??
        - TODO: looks pretty useless.. might be able to easily trim this off..
          - basic navigation via hjkl, arrow-keys + modifiers, ][, seem to cover most of it..
      - matches c-m-[arrow keys]

  - spc-x-spc, spc-c-spc
    - *doom's bindings*
      - *very useful to intuitively find more useful functions from doom's config..*
        - TODO: merge c-x functions and spc (doom)

m-x / spc-m-x (meow/god)
  - contains every function available (~7500 with default doom install, ~6750 with meow instead of evil key-bindings)
  - usually [module]-[function]

:[command] (evil)
  - NOTE: m-x !== :
    - there's sometimes a different number of functions...
    - i think the way they fuzzy find is different..

c-x / spc-x
  - meow's emacs bindings, which remains closer to emac's default bindings
    - *TODO: or is it the default emacs bindings..??*
  - it has a few funky bindings... i guess that's why doom had to create some sane defaults for it
  - i guess here for consistency, as it will be used by many modules
  - *TODO: NOTE: still has a few very important functions:*
    - buffer
    - save
    - close
    - dired-(j)ump
    - tab indent interactively!!

c-x, c-? / spc-x-spc
  - doom's "sane" emacs bindings, many similar to doom's space leader key, itself similar to emac's original bindings
   - looks really strange.. full of functions i wouldn't use..
   - better to look at doom's spc-keymap

c-c, c-?, spc-c (in meow)
  - *major-mode bindings*
  - *NOTE: doom's c-c, ? has a lot more functions. if you're looking for something, it could be found here*
  - *this is a great way to quickly and intuitively learn the main functions/bindings of a major mode*
    - *TODO: how to scroll through the c-x list..?*

c-c, l / spc-l (meow)
  - +localleader
  - *TODO: another optional set of major-mode bindings?*
    - for example, in org-mode

- spc-g == c-m
  - pure text editing stuff
    - jump, mark, regex, lisp stuff

- spc-spc
  - binded to c-spc
    - set-mark-command

**** meow leader keys:
  - NOTE: uses a different set of bindings in meow-doom
    - but looks like the default bindings...??:
      - (default +bindings +smartparens)) ; NOTE: needed for meow
      - at the end of init file
    - NOTE: doom's space key-chords are far more intutive (especially if coming from vi), whereas meow's are sparse, perhaps closer to vanilla, in need of customization..?




TODO: import leader key bindings from helix
TODO: import doom leader key bindings
  - it seems very close to c-c, ? (in no major mode?), but not quite, as it's missing buffers, vi shortcuts (search in file/cwd), other shortcuts, etc.
    - though, the search commands are neater beneath spc-s..
  - see [[file:/home/ra/.emacs.d/modules/config/default/][doom bindings]], evil-bindings.el seems to have everything... hmmmm, can that be stuffed under spc-d?

initially can keep them seperate, in seperate keys (spc-[key]), likely under spc-d, spc-j, and keep spc-j as my own custom menu

*doom-meow*
  - what i'm currently learning/discovering emacs on..

*DOOM*
  - i had a great initial experience using this, felt wayyyy easier and way more intuitive than using neovim!
    - helix seems to have taken much of it's space-key-chord shortcuts from doom, making it an easy jump
  - "tailored for Emacs bankruptcy veterans who want less framework in their frameworks, a modicum of stability (and reproducibility) from their package manager, and the performance of a hand rolled config (or better). It can be a foundation for your own config or a resource for Emacs enthusiasts to learn more about our favorite operating system."
  - "fast, closer to metal, opinionated, no forced plug-ins, nix/guix"
  - 150 modules!
  - "If you want something closer to what you know, and less involved to customize (less barebones basically), doom is what you want."
  - "I have tried them both and vanilla as well. I like doom the best - it has better shortcuts out the box, less buggy, uses traditional elisp for configuration as opposed to spacemacs which uses a proprietary thing you have to learn."
  - recommended by that one emacs guy from noisebridge

x/spacemacs
  - "a community-drive emacs distro"
    - sounds like 'oh my zsh', which is *not* good

prelude
  - TODO: worth trying, now that you can try emacs with different configs via a flag
  - way more stripped down, much closer to vanilla emacs
  - Prelude is basically a very light starter kit, whereas doom is a whole garage full of tools. (This does not mean doom has more utility, it just comes with more going on out of the box)
  - recommended by that one emacs guy from noisebridge





* doom
** install (doom)
follow the directions on the github
fish_add_path ~/.config/emacs/bin

windows:
scoop install emacs

set $env:home = "$home" in powershell profile
append $home/.emacs.d/bin to path

make folder in $home/.emacs.d
copy a clone of the doom repo there

doom sync
  - doom sync --aot
    - compiles natively
      - TODO: test if worth or not... maybe not worth it if updating frequently..
doom doctor
  - check for problems
doom run

NOTE: at the moment, must use bash to run it:
."C:\program files\Git\bin\sh.exe
  - run git bash
    - i think exists under msys2 (installed via scoop) too
doom run

add a shortcut
  - "C:\program files\git\bin\sh.exe" -c "/c/Users/ra/.emacs.d/bin/doom run"

..YAY! :D

  - my gist on installing doom for chromeos, including building emacs 29

** notes on how to maintain doom (+ post-install notes)

from github repo page:
doom sync
  - to synchronize your private config with Doom by installing missing packages, removing orphaned packages, and regenerating caches. Run this whenever you modify your private init.el or packages.el, or install/remove an Emacs package through your OS package manager (e.g. mu4e or agda).
doom upgrade
  - to update Doom to the latest release & all installed packages.
doom doctor
  - to diagnose common issues with your system and config.
doom env
  - to dump a snapshot of your shell environment to a file that Doom will load at startup. This allows Emacs to inherit your PATH, among other things.
doom build to recompile all installed packages (use this if you up/downgrade Emacs).



post-install notes: (from the doom install cli script)
But before you doom yourself, here are some things you should know:

1. Don't forget to run 'doom sync', then restart Emacs, after modifying
   ~/.doom.d/init.el or ~/.doom.d/packages.el.

   This command ensures needed packages are installed, orphaned packages are
   removed, and your autoloads/cache files are up to date. When in doubt, run
   'doom sync'!

2. If something goes wrong, run `doom doctor`. It diagnoses common issues with
   your environment and setup, and may offer clues about what is wrong.

3. Use 'doom upgrade' to update Doom. Doing it any other way will require
   additional steps. Run 'doom help upgrade' to understand those extra steps.

4. Access Doom's documentation from within Emacs via 'SPC h d h' or 'C-h d h'
   (or 'M-x doom/help')

Have fun!

** install icons
run nerd-icons-install-fonts function within emacs
  - TODO: not working..

** install meow key-bindings for doom
doom-meow
https://github.com/meow-edit/doom-meow
mkdir -p ~/.doom.d/modules/editor && git clone https://github.com/meow-edit/doom-meow ~/.doom.d/modules/editor/meow

Enable this module in your doom! block. (add (meow +your-desired-flags...) after the :editor section in init.el)

After you doom sync and restart Emacs, Meow will start in Normal state, so make sure that bindings have been set up; see Module flags.

The leader and localleader bindings are defined in <a href=”doom-module::config default +bindings”>doom-module::config default +bindings, so that module is required for them to work.

This module will not work smoothly with doom-module::editor evil, doom-module::editor god, or doom-module::editor objed. You must disable those modules in your doom! block to use this one.
