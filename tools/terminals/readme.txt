this folder is largely deprecated, as i've since discovered emacs, which replaces the mess of cli/terminal apps, and unifies all of their functionality to a single prgram, a single set of key-bindings, a single laguage, and is far more interactive and composable than shell piping i/o

see my conclusions in [shell-scripting] and [cli-shells]

yet, as terminals are still useful, i'm keeping it as is for now.. just for the sake of keeping some basic notes
