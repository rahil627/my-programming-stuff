TODO: to try

gitkraken 
  - get crackin'!
  - yet another electron app.. :/

sourcetree
  - actually C# for windows and obj-c for Mac...
    - great, but what a nightmare to maintain..!! :|

sublime merge
  - TODO: try this first!
    - god.. fuck linux.. have to learn editing the repo source list
      - https://www.sublimemerge.com/docs/linux_repositories
  - sounds low-key great, like sublime text itself

lazygit
  - a great case for tui apps!
  - though, since i use emacs.. i must magit






magit
  - will take time to learn..
  - FIXME: c-c c-c is a terrible joke to hide the git commit finalize binding..

github desktop
  - git made stupid simple
  - keep it open, and it will track changes and auto check-mark what has been changed since, once you click on it again
  - sometimes git renames fail (or it might be me renaming without git..)
  - diffs aren't very smart..
  - uses electron :/
    - though it makes sense, for them to provide a web-version of it..








source forges:

github
  - *to share public projects*
    - *but if you plan to share, might as well put it on codeberg..*
  - 420 million vs gitlabs' 5 million repos
  - *m$ bought it for strategic purposes..*
    - *co-pilot/ai data storage being the main problem..*

*gitlab*
  - *for private (and public!) projects*
    - it's just maybe that people will search this forge less than github.. but otherwise, i see no reason why github is better..
  1. self-hosted
  2. public-hosted
  
  

TODO: merge with above
github vs gitlab
    - https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/1cn560y/comment/l3cic5k/
      - OP, the right answer is Gitlab.

        Have always offered private repositories (Github didn't for a long time)
        
        Provide a hefty number of features for free which *really* help structurate a project if you're ready to invest some elbow grease (do not that many things related to advanced continuous integration and testing require a paid subscription AFAIR, but everything is explicit on their website anyways).
        
        DOESN'T GIVE ALL YOUR DATA FOR COPILOT TO USE.
        
        Continously improves Gitlab in every aspect (and those are not just cosmetic things, there are real new features actually useful, if only for a subset of high-level automation) AND regularly pushes back those innovations in free version (I don't understand in detail how they balance free vs paid for new features but I did witness that anyways).
        
        Github provides a bit more visibility because many more projects around and historically the first share git repository, but unless you're a new developer just trying some repository to drop basic (but well written!) projects to sell him/herself to employers, it's reaaaally not worth tying yourself up with Microsoft."
    - https://www.reddit.com/r/git/comments/1os4now/gitlab_vs_github/
      - open-source
      - better ci/cd
      - can self-host (without a paid edition..)
      - "Gitlab is simpler and more integrated. Github has better interface and features."
      - "Github is owned by Microsoft. This gives them access to Azure Infrastructure, integrations with VSCode etc. but also means their strategy is now all about AI and copilot."
    - welp, that's that..



codeburg
  - *non-profit, privacy-focused*
  - *restricts non-FOSS code*
    - https://docs.codeberg.org/getting-started/faq/#how-about-private-repositories%3F
      - Codeberg's mission is to promote free/libre software. Keeping software private is obviously not our primary use case, but we acknowledge that private repositories are useful or necessary at times.
      ...The rules of thumb are:... If you are a contributor to free/libre software projects, we allow up to 100 MB of private content for your convenience. Use it for your personal notes, your side project or any other you want to keep private.
      ...then have to send a requrest to get more space..
  - third after github and gitlab..?

forgejo
  - the open-source fork of gitea, after some politics
    - "Forgejo was initially created in December 2022 as a fork of Gitea. The fork occurred after a for-profit limited corporation ran by the lead maintainer of the project, Lunny Xiao, silently transferred Gitea's trademarks and operations to the company and began to establish an open-core model."
  - "Codeberg, one of the major forges using Gitea at the time, migrated to Forgejo and has become the de jure lead maintainers of the project"

gitea
  - rip

bitbucket
  - allowed private repos at a time when github did not
  - read it sucks..
  - owned by atlassian
    - *seems to be a strategy to tie it to it's own products for integration*, much like microsoft's strategy with github..
    - atlassian product suite?
      - Jira = top notch product
      - Bitbucket = worse than github
      - Bamboo = worse than Jenkins, TeamCity
      - Confluence = 90's UI
      - https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/5o8xy8/comment/dcht697/
        - a comment from 9 years ago..
  
sourceforge
  - what up OG
  - now owned by slashdot









version control software:

https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1bsptek/what_should_i_use_for_source_control_and_why_in/
  - for games, the problem is non-code files: binaries and size limit (5gb)
  - why git lfs?: "It has a “checkout” feature which forces all files to be read-only until you manually check them out (like a library book). This will sync with the server and allow your coworkers to see what files you are working on. It useful for large projects that involve a lot of binary files as they can’t be diff-merged anyway, so traditional source control loses some of its value in that regard.
    When I used Unity I stuck to Git since the scene files are in YAML, but Unreal uses binary files for blueprints and levels so it makes more sense to use a tool designed for binary file support."
  
  - the old svn seems to hold (jon blow still uses it)


fossil (scm)
  - written in C by the guy who wrote sqllite ("the most used database in the world")
    - makes it infinitely better than the chaos of linux cli apps that git relies on
  - basically a portable github, including wiki, even chat(!), etc.
  - made for small, tight teams, not chaotic open-source pull-request stuff
  - https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/5yrhri/comment/desosfy/?st=j17tbcd3&sh=72751049
    - in-depth comparison
    - "Fossil targets a more specialized use case than Mercurial or Git and aims at handling that well. That use case is self-hosted repositories for small teams (say, up to a few dozen contributors) and individuals. To this end, it has built-in mechanisms for distributed ticket management and a wiki, for example. On the other hand, external contributions are a bit more cumbersome, though the bundle mechanism offers the equivalent of Mercurial's and Git's patch contributions."
  
git:
  - Slowly took over and has a monopoly on version control systems. I believe it took over thanks to GitHub, a place where code is to be shared.
  - a billion tools are now made for it: magit (emacs), lazygit (tui), every text-editor/ide must have a git extensions
  - https://www.progclub.net/~key720/tutorials/git_bitbucket/
   - great guide to use git on windows
  - need to learn how to update a fork
   - reset current branch -> pull -> merge?

svn:
https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/17bkkfh/comment/k5juz4e/
"I’ve used SVN for game development. Recently, even.

If you try to use Git Flow in SVN you are going to be miserable. SVN has branches, but it’s not something you would do casually, like you do in Git. (IMO, Git Flow is kind of awful anyway—but that is more my opinion, and a much larger discussion.)

You are probably going to want to self-host. You don’t have to, but it’s not like there’s a svnhub.com.

Since SVN is fully centralized, you are always going to be limited by your connection to the server. If your server is on the internet, then maybe you have to wait a long time for that 2 GB change you made to upload. With Git, you can at least get a bunch of work done, and then push later.

SVN may be better for dealing with large binary files, but it still lacks some features you may want for purging old versions of binary files that you are confident you won’t need in the future.

The workflow I use is trunk-based development, where you have one main branch, and then you cut a release branch for each release. This is easy enough in both Git and SVN."
