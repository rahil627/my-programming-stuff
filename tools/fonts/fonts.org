* install
** windows
double-click .ttf file -> install button
  - usually four files: regular, bold, italic, bolditalic

open the font-name-variable.wght file and click install
  - it will install all of the fonts (found in the 'static' folder) automatically

** linux
*** debian
(including chromeos's debian container)

NOTE: for chromeos, it will only be available to linux apps, not to chromeos/android apps

check for packages on apt first, for easy maintenance

mkdir -p ~/.local/share/fonts
  - and save them here

fc-cache -fv
  - load and see all font dirs
  
*** arch-linux
for arch, just use package managers to install them
see https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/fonts

pacman -S adobe-source-code-pro-fonts
yay -S ttf-meslo
...

see all fonts installed by package:
pacman -Qs ttf

see names of fonts, needed to set string in config files
fc-list | fzf

the way to install without using package manager, for other distros:
/usr/share/fonts or a local dir (/.fonts/ is deprecated)



* places to find and play with fonts
https://www.programmingfonts.org/
  - perfect editor view
  - contains most popular contemporary fonts
  - pin function to make it easy to compare
  - various language and themes selections too
  - links to place to download it (usually github)
  - public / on github
    - likely easy to add more fonts, languages, etc.

fonts.google.com
  - you can download most free fonts from here
  - use this site to check out contemporary pop fonts
  - https://fonts.google.com/?preview.size=12&category=Monospace
    - compare fonts here

powerline (bundle)
  - bundle of fonts from the popular PowerLevel10k zsh bundle
  - https://github.com/powerline/fonts
  - NOTE: source code pro for powerline uses a more bold font (medium?) and adds:
    - bad: bottom serif to 'i', lowers the '_',
    - good: otherwise does many good things like: a better 'g', bigger symbols, aligned symbols, etc.

x/www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads
  - long single page web page contains all fonts to download
  - nerd fonts contain a massive, unnecessary amount of symbols that take up a massive amount of space (2mb with ligatures vs 100mb nerd font version)

https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/fonts
  - also a great resource, listing some pop font packages and more resources

https://archlinux.org/packages/?sort=&repo=Extra&q=ttf&maintainer=&flagged=
  - ttf search of the arch package repo

https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts
  - another good pop collection

* current settings

see [emacs config]
  - TODO: merge from emacs config


NOTE: the color theme of the editor effects the text's color contrast which can feel like the font-weight! (try Aura Dark (soft text) color theme in vs-code)

** windows, OLED laptop
vs-code
  - office code pro 11
  - consolas 12
  - font-size: 11-13 (14 is default)
  - font-weight: light (300?) to regular-light (350) on OLED screen
  - consolas looks better than source code pro, but it doesn't have a lighter weight

terminal
  - see terminal config for more info
  - **monofoki**
    - NOTE: for this particular font, must override line-height: 1 to match mononoki
    - font-size: 8-9
  - TODO: can play with turning off anti-aliasing
    - powershell -> advanced -> text antialiasing
    - without anti-aliasing it look clearer, but fonts with curves struggle

** shitty chromebook

emacs
  - quite picky about font sizes
    - TODO: try text-scale mode
      - maybe can test with +zen-text-scale
  - monofoki
  - dejavu sans mono
    - quite nice, and comes with chromeos..??
      - used to be the terminal/crosh default on chromeos!

using default terminal app
  - ubuntu mono 14
    - this one seems to work really well, similar to monofoki (especially the m character), whereas many others suffer from various problems, from being unreadable because the screen sucks, or just squashing line height upon font size, or just plain too wide.
  - by default comes with many popular programming fonts
    - note: it come with some open-source/free versions of fonts that may not look so great: inconsolata (consolas)

the linux container come with the 'croscore' fonts package
  - arimo (sans-serif)
  - tinos (serif)
  - cousine (monospace)
  
chrome (browser/OS?) defaults (for reference):
font size: 18
standard: carlito
serif: georgia
sans: arimo
fixed-width: roboto




* current favorites

see [emacs config]
  - TODO: merge notes from emacs config

TODO: need to try consolas in a lighter weight
TODO try source code pro with a more narrow width

**office code pro <- hasklig (light) ~= source code pro**
  - terminal: size 10-11, weight: regular/normal
  - vscode: size 11-12, weight: light
  - best/most comfy for my eyes long-term
  
**monofoki <- mononoki**
  - 12, same size as consolas
  - slightly wider and less seriphy than consolas, and therefore more comfy, but less readable
  - a little more funky
  - only one font weight
  - using in terminal
  
**consolas**
  - 12
  - a classic on Windows
  - **still looks the best on windows**, especially vs-code, where it is the default
  - damn near impossible to beat
  - small horizontal space between characters
  - 1-2 font sizes smaller than others (marketing?)
  - **comes with only one weight: regular, no light?**
  - shipped with vs-studio and thus strongly associated with c#
  
**ubunto mono**
  - comes with chromeos's terminal app
    - 14 (default)



hack
  - 11, same size as source code pro
  - taller than source code pro, dejavu-like
  - only one font weight

meslo (LG S)
  - terminal: size 10, 10.5, 11
  - also really good
  - tall like dejavu
  - wayyyy more seriphy than source code pro


trying:
monaspace neon/argon var
  - i might like this better than meslo!

monaspace krypton var
  - a little lower-resolution for terminal



progressions:
monaspace neon <- office code pro ~= hasklig ~= source code pro
mononoki & agave

cascadia code ~= fira code <- anonymous pro (seriphy)
mesloLGS nf ~= fira mono <- dejavu sans mono
hack <- source code pro & dejavu sans mono & fira
jetbrains (sans) mono <- dejavu sans mono
  - all of these are tall'ish like dejavu

i think only looks good in one size, no scaling 

cozette <-?- proggy fonts
  - proggy clean 16
    - tiny, pixel-font-like, indeed very clean!

** hand-written, with a feather-pen

lotion

** the standards

cascadia mono/code
  - has a light version

  - but it does have better/narrower character width
  - **great in windows terminal**, showing **really thick strokes**

monaspace
  - a collection by github
  - **neon**
    - a bigger source code pro with some more seriphy-ness
    - very good, roundy
    - good character height, not abnormally tall like dejavu-derived ones
    - i think hack is still better
  - argon
    - a less seriphy neon, feels roman
    - competes with hack, but i think hack is better

    - a more seriphy neon

  - radon
    - sharpie marker style!
  - krypton
    - lower-resolution/roboty, but not pixely

hack

  - somewhere between dejavu and fira's serphiness
  - very close to consolas, similar small size font with space between lines
  - same as hasklig with more seriphy i,t,f,etc.

Meslo LG S NF
  - NF = nerd font
  - just fixes symbol positions from dejavu sans mono
  - The recommended font is the product of many individuals. Its origin is Bitstream Vera Sans Mono, which has given birth to Menlo, which in turn has spawned Meslo. Finally, extra glyphs have been added to Meslo with scripts forked from Nerd Fonts. The final font is released under the terms of Apache License.
 
**office code pro**
  - forked from source code pro, combines a lot of good things from other fonts
  - possibly my current favorite

hasklig
  - source code pro + ligatures (->, =>, etc.)
  - other weights:
    - https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/src/unpatched-fonts/Hasklig
      - somewhere in-between source code pro regular and light
 
iosevka

  - ...i don't like it at all! feels scrunched by width

cascadia code
  - very gamey 'n seriphy, like mononoki and fira code
    - too seriphy
  - high quality, showing surprising thickness like consolas
  - used by Microsoft for it's terminal

fira code =? jetbrains mono
  - adds space width, adds some serif-ness, probably has code-related glyphs
  - i prefer mono
  
JetBrains (sans) mono
  - a cute robotic version of dejavu, with long characters shortened nicely

dejavu sans mono == noto sans mono? ~= roboto mono
  - tall'ish
  - more line space on odd numbers, compare size 12 and 13
  - size 14 is nice 'n big, i dig it

source code pro
  - a classic
  - more sans than dejavu! very clear, roundy, 'n spacey
  - easier on the eyes as the regular weight is light
  - great in small sizes
  - squashed vertical space between lines
  - by Adobe (but i guess it's now open-source)
  - git clone --depth 1 --branch release https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro.git ~/.fonts/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro
  - fc-cache -f -v ~/.fonts/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro

anonymous pro
  - seriphy, round, just feels off
  
Cantarell
  - used by Manjaro for ui elements

Cousine
  - squashes the f and l, i prefer it longer

    - nerd take 160mb :(

Menlo
  - a customized Bitstream Vera Sans Mono
  - Apple Font
    - used by Apple's dev tools 'n terminal

Inconsolata
  - open source consolas, though not as good as the original

DejaVu Sans Mono
  - same as bitstream vera sans mono?
Andale Mono
Vera Mono

lucida console
  - ships with windows os
  - 10 in notepad/notepad2, 11 in notepad++

* TODO merge, from an old file

kooteney*** - small tabs, yet consolas look, not monospaced
open symbol - unique, has different symbols
ocr a std - too console-ish
proggysquare - looks nice!
droid sans mono**** - like consolas, but a bit longer vertically, tough competition with consolas


* otf vs ttf:

basically: mac os doesn't care for ttf, all look the same. windows will render ttf. ttf is capable of better hinting code but requires more effort on part of the font designers 

https://www.reddit.com/r/typography/comments/ci4nwk/comment/ev1jy42/
  "In the modern era of font development, OTF and TTF are very, very similar.

  OTF stands for Postscript-flavored OpenType.
  TTF stands for Truetype-flavored Opentype.

  They both share the same capabilities and general structure (literally, the tables within a font are near identical). Here's a general sense of the differences that matter the most:

  Math. OTF uses Cubic curves, TTF uses Quadratic. In the old days this mattered a lot more since printers were more limited, but nowadays this doesn't matter much.

  Hinting. Hinting is code that helps the OS achieve consistent rendering across the font at different point sizes. OTF supports alignment zones / blue zones, which marks stems, and key parts of the glyphs to enable the OS to render the letters. TTF uses full-on hinting, which is much more involved than the zones in OTF.

  So what matters more, is what the OS does with an OTF or TTF file.

  Mac (for the most part) ignores hinting entirely and renders all fonts the same. This works fairly well on high-end screens with high resolutions, but falls apart at smaller sizes on low resolution screens.

  Windows prioritizes achieving high contrast character rendering, and thus does not assume that all fonts should be rendered the same. So it relies on hinting code to achieve good results. As a result, you'll often see well-hinted TTF fonts render really crisp and clearly on Windows, whereas OTF seem a bit blurry. Do note, though, that badly-hinted TTF fonts will look terrible on Windows. So I suppose there's a bit more risk with TTFs in having good quality—best to purchase them from quality type foundries who know what they're doing.

  As a type designer, I tend to like OTF because they're simpler and easier to get out the door. But as someone who also cares about consistent, quality rendering across all devices, TTF is a significantly better option."
